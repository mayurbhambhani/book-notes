## Non Voilent Communication

### Chapter 1: Giving From The Heart

- Giving is the best form of recieving.
- Giving should not result in expectation. If if does then its a favor.
- Selfless giving benefits both the giver and the receiver. The reciever enjoys the gift without worrying about the consequences that accompany gifts given out of fear, guilt, shame or desire for gain.
- The person you are going to practice NYC with, doesnt need to be aware of the process. Given enough time they would also start behaving the same way. And eventually you will be able to respond to each other in a selfless and compassionate manner.
- **NVC Process**
  - Observe. Observe what is affecting you. And observe without judgement. Just observe. Just see what is happening.
  - Feeling: Now think on how it affects you. What feelings the observation is evoking.
  - Needs: Think on why it is making you feel a certain way. What deeper needs and desires are causing that feeling.
  - Request: Create a request explaining the above three things.
  - Example: A mom saying to her kid, "When I see two balls of soiled socks under the coffee table and another three next to the TV, I feel irritated because I am needing more order in the rooms that we share in common. Would you be able to put your socks in your room or in the washing machine?"
- Two parts of NVC
  - Use the four components to express yourself honestly.
  - Recieving empathically through the four components.
- While listening
  - Observe first
  - Think what the other person is feeling. Verify by asking if you are not sure.
  - Think about the deep needs and desires that are causing these feelings. Verify if you are not sure.
  - Ask them what you can do to address the situation.
  - After you have understood, you can talk about acceptable solutions.


## Chatper 2: Communication That Blocks Compassion

- This chapter lists down the behaviors which instead of helping the other person understand what we need, alienate them, infruriate them and often the result is the opposite of what we wanted. What is more, they also make us mad and the whole process becomes a bad incidence. The other person will just get defensive and they will resist in providing what we ask for.
- Moralistic Judgements: You are lazy, You are selfish etc. Dont pass the verdict. Dont tell the other person "what" they are. Observe, feel, find the need and request. Dont focus on what they did wrong. Just describe what they need. Dont tell them their behavior was wrong. Just tell them the behavior you need.
- Classifying and judging people promotes violence.
- Dont compare them with others. Comparisons are a form of judgement.
- Denial of Responsiblity: If you get angry, you are not the victim of your anger. You are the cause of it. Dont remove yourself away from responsibility. We deny responsibility for our actions when we attribute their cause to factors outside ourselves.
  - I cleaned my room because I had to
  - I drink because I am an alcoholic
  - I hit my child because he ran into the street.
  - I lied to the client because the boss told me to.
  - I started smoking because all my friends do.
  - I hate going to work but I do it because I am a husband and a father.
  - I was overcome by the urge to eat the candy bar.
- Dont use language which suggest that you were not responsible. This makes us dangerous. We justify our wrong doings if we think that the cause of our actions lies outside of us.
- Dont threaten people. Either they will fight back to prove that you cant threathen them. Or they will comply out of fear. Both alternatives wont provide real progress. 
- Thinking based on who deserves what blocks compassionate communication.

### Chapter 3: Observing Without Evaluating

- When we combine observations and evaluation, we decrease the likelihood that others will hear our intended message. Instead they will hear criticism. 
- NVC is a process language which discourages static generalizations; instead, evaluations are to be based on observations *specific to context and time*.
- Examples: Observation versus evaluation
  - Use of verb *to be* without indicating that the evaluator takes responsibility for evaluation:  You are too generous **versus**, When I see you give all your lunch money to other, I think you are being too generous.
  - Use of verbs with evaluative connotations :Doug procrastinates **versus**, Doug only studies for exams the night before.
  - Implying that one's inferences about another person's thoughts, feelings, intentions, or desires are the only ones possible: She won't get her work in **versus**, It is possible, based on my observation, that she might not be able to get her work in
  - Confusion of prediction with certainty: If you dont eat balanced meals, your health will be impaired **versus**, If you dont eat balanced meals, I fear your health may be impaired.
  - Failure to be specific about referents: Immigrants dont take care of their property **versus**, I have not seen my neighbor immigrant family shovel the snow on their sidewalk.
  - Use of words denoting ability without indicating that an evaluation has been made: Hank Smith is a poor soccer player **versus**, Hank Smith has not scored a goal in 20 games.
  - Use of adverbs and adjectives in a way that do not indicate an evaluation has been made: Jim is ugly **versus**, Jim's look dont appeal to me.
- The words *always*, *never*, *ever*, *whenever*, etc. express observations when used in the following ways.
  - Whenever I have observed Jack on the phone, he has spoken at least thirty minutes.
  - I cannot recall your ever writing to me.
- But sometimes these words are use to exaggerate and provoke defensiveness rather than compassion.
  - You are always busy
  - She is never there when she is needed.
- You seldom do I wand **versus**, The last three times I initiated an activity, you said you did not want to do it.
- He frequently comes over **versus**, He comes over at least thrice a week.

### Chapter 4: Identifying And Expressing Feelings.

- Our vocbulary name calling is richer than the vocabulary we have for describing our emotional states.
- Sometimes we dont even are aware of what we are feeling. Let alone expressing them clearly.
- Instead of expressing what we are feeling if we criticize the other party for our negative emotional state, it can become a self fulfilling prophecy.
- Expressing our vulnerability can help resolve conflicts. Side Note: The example given is of the author who is a white male, who admitted to a class of black students that he was nervous. I dont completely agree that it works in all cases. In some cases it might make you like a loser. It works in those cases when people are defensive against you thinking you might attack them. In such cases expression of vulnerability might work well. But if you are already in a weak position, it will further weaken your position.
- A common confusion, generated by the English language is that the phrase *I feel* is many times is not followed by a feeling, Ex. *I feel I didn't get a fair deal.*
- I feel is sometimes followed by
  - Words such as *that, like, as if*:
    - I feel that you should know better.
    - I feel like a failure
    - I feel as I am living with a wall.
  - The pronouns *I, he, she, they, you, it*
    - I feel I am constantly on call.
    - I feel it is useless.
  - Names and nouns referring to people
    - I feel Amy has been pretty responsible.  
    - I feel my boss is being manipulative.
- Conversely, it is not necessary to use feel at all when we are expressing feelings.
  - I feel irritated can be simply translated as I am irritated.
- We need to distinguish between feelings and thoughts and our language should express that.
- We also need to distinguish between what we think we are and what we feel.
  - I am a bad cricket player *versus** I feel disappointed in myself as a cricket player.
- We also need to decouple our observations, of what other people are doing around us or behaving with us, and our feelings.
  - I feel unimportant *versus* I feel sad.
  - I feel misunderstood *versus* I feel frustrated.
  - Here is a list of words that are not feelings.

### Chapter 5: Taking Responsibility For Our Feelings.

- People are not disturbed by things and situations, but by the view they take of them.
- What others say and do might be the stimulus but never the cause of our feelings.
- We need to accept responsbility for what we do to generate our feelings.
- Four options to recieve negative messages.
  - Blame ourselves.
  - Blame others.
  - Sense our own feelings and needs.
  - Sense others' feelings and needs
- Your language should not blame the other person for your feelings. Instead, of *I feel feeling because you..* , we should use, *I feel feeling because I..*. Other examples..
  - I feel hurt because you said that you dont love me *versus* I feel hurt because I need an assurance and confirmation of love from you.
- Judgements, criticisms, diagnoses and intepretation of others are all alienated expressions for our needs.
- Instead of expressing our needs and feelings correctly, if we resort to judgements, then the other person will either get defensive or will make a counter attack.
- If we wish for a compassionate response we need to connect our feeling to our needs without blaming the other person for the feeling.
- Emotional Slavery: We need to make sure we are scarificing our needs to make others happy. That just causes resentment
- Obnoxious: If we keep doing the above, we will become obnoxious and unreasonable and will start making demands that fulfil our needs without considering other people's needs.
- Emotional Liberation: We need to find a middle ground each time. A win win scenario.

### Chapter 6: Requesting That Which Would Enrich Life
- Use positive action language. Negative requests are likely to provoke resistance.
- This has to be used while framing goals as wells. Say what you want to be done. "Dont get angry" wont work. "Always stay calm" would work.
- Frame your request in the form of concrete actions. Being vague and abstract or ambiguous will not ensure the correct response.
- Often the use of vague and abstract language can mask oppressive interpersonal games.
- So requests should be clear, positive, and in concrete action form. Only then it will reveal clearly what we want. Forcing ourselves to frame requests as described will give us a lot of clarity of thought.
- What is more, vague language can also cause internal confusion on what you want. 
- Sometimes we are not conscious of what we are requesting. We just express our feelings and expect others to understand our requests.
- The more clearly we understand what we are requesting, the more chance there is that the request will get fulfilled.
- Requests unaccompanied by feelings and needs sound like demands.
- To make sure there are no misunderstanings, we can request the listener to reflect the message back. And dont tell them that they misunderstood, or that not what you meant. Thank them for repeating, then say "I can see that I did not make myself as clear as I would have liked, so let me try again". Express appreciation when your listener tried to meet your request for a reflection.
- People might get offended when asked to reflect back. Empathize with them. Make it clear that you dont have any reservations on their comprehension capabilities.
