## This thing called sleep

### Chapter 1- To Sleep…

The author talks about how he went into sleep research. It started with his research on predicting what kind of dementia a person will develop in the future by observing the brainwave patterns during sleep.

### Chapter 2 Caffeine, Jet Lag, and Melatonin.

Here we learn about circadian rhythm which is our biological clock. This clock is around 24 hrs 15 minutes long. This circadian rhythm is regulated by melatonin which is produced by the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the brain, which calibrates your body clock using the amount of light. Hence melatonin is released at night and this tells your body it's time to sleep. It just signals it, it does not generate sleep itself. Hence sleeping pills that induce melatonin secretion only give your body a nighttime signal. Those pills won't generate sleep but they aim to generate a melatonin-generated placebo. When we are sleeping melatonin concentration decreases and is gone with the morning sunlight which is detected even when our eyelids are closed.

Jetlag is a problem because your circadian rhythm takes time to adjust to the new time of sunlight to dark.
Jet lags are worse when we travel towards the east. Did not understand the logic though. 


There is another chemical that helps us sleep. It's called Adenosine. The more its concentration in the brain the more sleepy will feel. The mode sleepy we feel. Circadian rhythm and Adenosine are independent. But they are aligned. 

Caffeine works by blocking the effects of adenosine. However adenosine keeps accumulating throughout the caffeine-induced wakefulness and as the effects of caffeine wear off, we again feel sleepy. 
Caffeine has an average half-life of 5-7 hrs in the body. Hence a Coffee in the evening won't let you sleep on time. Even Decaf has 30% coffee. Thus, coffee is only suitable once i.e. in the morning.

The circadian rhythm is the wake drive signal and the adenosine is the sleep drive signal. If you plot these two signals on a graph where the x-axis represents time. Then the urge to sleep can be measured by the distance between the two signals. This distance is zero in the morning and highest at night. The high point varies from person to person. Some people are early risers and some are late bloomers. Late bloomers will struggle through their life because the world accepts them to rise early.

#### Signs of insufficient sleep
Can't wake up w/o an alarm clock.  
Can sleep again around 11.  
Re-reading the same sentence on the digital screen.   
There is a questionnaire included in the book.  


### Chapter 3: Defining and Generating Sleep

This chapter talks about REM(Rapid Eye Movement) and NREM(non-REM).
Sleep is an alternating cycle between these two wherein the beginning of the sleep NREM takes major time of the cycle and vice versa in the end.
NREM is further dissected into 4 stages. Stages 3-4 are deep sleep stages.
REM is where dreams happen and the body is completely paralyzed.
During NREM brain wave has a regular wave pattern. Think of a stadium where all people are neurons. When all are chanting together the sound pattern would resemble the brain wave pattern during NREM.
During REM the brainwave pattern is not distinguishable from the wakeful brain wave pattern. But the eyes move rapidly from left to right and the muscles are completely relaxed(floppy, atone.).

Think of the wakeful state as the reception state. Where the brain receives the information and stores it into the main memory.

NREM state processes this data and transfers the skills and information in the long-term memory.
The REM state is the integration where these new raw ingredients are connected with the past.


### Chapter 4: Who sleeps, How do we Sleep and How Much

1. Without exception every animal studied to date sleeps or engages in something remarkably like sleep.
2. Sleep among all organisms differs in 4 ways. 
   1. Daily duration
   2. Amount of REM sleep
   3. The way we sleep(humans lie horizontally, some animals sleep on trees)
   4. Change of sleep patterns under rare circumstances( fasting makes us sleep less, some migratory birds can stay sleep deprived for a long time while migrating ).
3. If we lose some sleep by pulling an all-nighter one night or not completing our complete sleep on a particular day. We don’t get that back. It is just lost.
4. How should we sleep. Biphasic. 8 hrs in the night and 60-90 minutes nap during the day.
5. Humans sleep in the REM stage 25% of their sleep time. The whole animal kingdom averages around 9%.
6. For some birds or animals, the left and right half of the brains can take turns to sleep. This is called uni-hemispheric sleep. Humans have a very mild version of it. It only happens when we sleep in unfamiliar environments. One half of the brain sleeps a little lighter than the other. That's why the first night in the hotel the quality of sleep is not so great.



### Chapter 5: Changes in sleep across the lifespan

#### Sleep Before Birth
- Most of the time is spent in sleep.
- Babies kick because during REM sleep the brain can not paralyze the body because the part of the brain responsible for sleep paralysis is not developed yet.
- Only in the final trimester, there are 2-3 hours of wakefulness.
- In the last two weeks, the REM sleep increases. About 9-12 hrs a day is spent in REM sleep.
- A lot of neural connections are generated in the brain during the last bout of REM sleep. This phase is called synaptogenesis. Think of REM sleep as an Internet Service Provider that provides new neighborhoods of the brains with vast networks of fiber optic cables. Everything is connected to everything and there is a lot of redundancy
- If this REM sleep is disturbed then there are very bad consequences. Hence mothers should not consume alcohol.
- In the infant stages also REM sleep is very important. Giving alcohol to babies can lower the quality of REM sleep and hence can have long-lasting impacts.


#### Childhood sleep
- Infants sleep in a polyphasic manner as opposed to the monophasic manner used by adults.
- A good funny book on the above phenomena is Go the Fuck to Sleep. The audio version is even better it seems. Its narrated by Samuel Jackson
- With every year the nighttime sleep increases and the infant goes towards the monophasic sleep pattern. The circadian rhythm is said around 4.
- The NREM/REM sleep ratio is around 50/50 in the first 6 months. Around 5 the REM sleep decreases and the ratio becomes 70/30. Later in life, this ratio is stabilized to 80/20 in favor of NREM and stays there for the rest of the life.

#### Sleep Adolescence
- As we saw that during the initial stages of the brain the internet service provider everything with everything, but this is not a good long-term strategy, some connections in the brain need higher bandwidth and some don't need any bandwidth at all. So between the initial stage of life and adolescence after getting enough statistics the ISP then rearranges the connections to be more efficient. This happens during the NREM sleep during adolescence and hence the NREM sleep increases during adolescence and comes down to its natural levels down after this synaptic pruning.
- This synaptic pruning starts from the backside of the brain, the area responsible for vision and perception, and ends at the front, the area responsible for rational thought and hence rationality is among the last brain functions that get developed in the brain and hence teenagers are mostly irrational.
- Hence in adolescence the deep sleep or NREM sleep provides necessary neural pruning.
- If this pruning doesn't happen properly then there is a risk of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders
- The circadian rhythm of a child runs on an earlier schedule and the circadian rhythm of a teenager runs on a later schedule. And hence teenagers tend to stay up late. The worst part is they will sleep late and their dads will wake them up early in the morning thinking their kids are lazy. This interrupts the important pruning phase. Although in early adulthood it becomes normal


#### Sleep in middle life and old age

- Older adults need less sleep is a myth.
- They are just not able to generate the sleep they need.
- Them not getting enough sleep contributes to aging.
- As we go towards the late 20s and 30s, a decline in deep sleep is observed, both in quantity and quality.
- By the age of 70 we lose 80% of the sleep our young minds enjoyed.
- Sleeping pills are not a good solution.
- The older we get the more our sleep is fragmented, and hence the quality of sleep is not that great.
- Elders should also take care while going to bathrooms during the night due to fragmented sleep and bladder problems. The mind is not completely efficient and is groggy when they wake up during the night and thus they run a risk of falling. They should always turn on the lights and give their brain a chance to collect itself before getting up from the bed. They should sleep by a nighttime light. Have motion sensed light in the bathroom if possible. They should remove obstacles and rugs on their way from bed to the bathroom and there should be a phone by their bed for emergencies.
- Another issue with sleep in old age is that of the circadian rhythm. This change asks for an earlier bedtime. Hence evening naps are to be avoided.
- Circadian rhythms can be changed via
  - In the morning always wear goggles when going into the sunlight.
  - In the late afternoon go out in the sunlight, wear had and sunscreen if required but don't wear goggles.
  - Older adults can also consider taking melatonin pills. Only after consulting with doctors.
- The reason deep sleep declines in older age is that the parts of the brain responsible for generating the deep sleep degenerate the first. 
- As deep sleep is important for cementing facts and muscle memory older people become forgetful.

## Why should you sleep?

### Chapter 6: Benefits of Sleep
- Sleep heals emotional wounds, helps you learn and remember, gifts you with solutions to challenging problems, and prevents sickness and infection.
- Sleep is not the absence of wakefulness. It is a complex, metabolically active, and ordered series of unique stages.
- Sleep helps the brain before learning to prepare for making new memories and then after learning to cement those memories and prevent forgetting.
  
#### Sleep the night before learning
- Whatever we learn during the day goes to the hippocampus, a long finger-shaped structure tucked deep on either side of our brains. It is like a pendrive. Once it is full more information cant be added. The data from the hippocampus is transferred to long-term memory(the cortex) using the NREM brain waves. Hence deep sleep transfers this data. Failure to sleep will mean that the pendrive would still be full the next day and no new information can be added
- As deep sleep is weak on old adults, hence they cant cram new facts easily. As the hippocampus is not completely emptied each night.
- This data transfer activity is especially more active in the morning hours and hence waking up after six hours also will result in not emptying the hippocampus fully.

#### Sleep the night after learning
- The facts are cemented and they are shifted to long-term memory.
- Sleep also offers a recovery service for corrupted files. Memories you are not able to retrieve are also strengthened during sleep. The memories which are lost soon after learning can be recalled after a good night's sleep.
- Instructions to the brain on what is important and should be retained work. This is called targeted memory activation. We can also inform the brain on what is ok to forget and it will do the job.
- Sleep also cleans the brain of unimportant facts to free up resources.

#### Sleep for motor skills
- The term muscle memory is a misnomer. Muscle has no memory.
- Practice a skill enough in the evening and you might not get results. Waking up the next morning after a good night's sleep will do the trick.
- Practice alone doesn't make perfect. Practice with sleep makes perfect.
- Motor memories operate below the level of consciousness.
- Last 2 hours of 8 hr sleep are responsible for this. The NREM during this time strengthens motor skills. Hence a full night's sleep for athletes is very important.

#### Sleep for creativity

- Daily learning creates small clusters of a graph. All the information we have collected so far forms a forest of various connected components. Dreams connect these connected components. It also performs a path compression in the connected components and thus finds connection in the pieces of information and learnings we have accumulated to solve the problems we are currently focussing on. This boosts creativity and hence REM sleep helps in creativity

### Chapter 7: Sleep deprivation and the brain

- Struck by the weight of damning scientific evidence, the Guinness book of world records has stopped recognizing attempts to break the sleep deprivation world records. Considering what kind of risk attempts they recognize, we should get a fair idea of how dangerous is sleep deprivation.
- Sleep deprivation may cause following neurological and psychiatric conditions
  - Alzheimer's
  - Anxiety
  - Depression
  - Bipolar disorder
  - Suicide
  - Stroke
  - Chronic pain
- Drowsy driving is equivalent to drunk driving. This happens because of total sleep or microsleep while driving.
- Sleeping only 7 hrs a day for 10 days causes sleep deprivation equal to not sleeping for 24 hrs straight.
- We don't know how sleep-deprived we are. Because of habitual less sleep we acclimatize to the new lowered level of alertness.
- The heady cocktail of sleep deprivation and drunk driving does not add the bad effects. It multiplies them. Wake up at 7, go for drinks in the evening. Have some drinks and return around 2 am. This is a recipe for disaster.
- Power naps came into existence when pilots had to decide on the timing of a 40-120 minute nap during a 36 hrs flight. It is not an alternative to 8 hrs of regular sleep.
- The odds are 1 in 12k that you are the person who can survive on 5 hrs of sleep.
- Sleep deprivation also makes us emotionally irrational. Amygdala is the gas pedal for emotions and the pre-frontal cortex is the brake pedal. Sleep deprivation causes too much gas pedal and not enough brake pedal. Hence there are a lot of mood swings of high range.
- The negative extreme of the mood swing causes depression, the positive extreme causes sensation-seeking addiction, risk-taking. It might cause relapse in people after rehab.
- Trading sleep for learning is not a good idea. We won't learn much and whatever we learn would be short-term.
- If you fail to get a good night's sleep the first night after learning, you lose the chance to consolidate those memories, and even if you catchup in the coming days it won't happen.




### Chapter 8: Sleep Deprivation and the body

- Sleep deprivation may cause the following physiological issues
  - Cancer
  - Diabetes
  - Heart Attacks
  - Infertility
  - Weight Gain
  - Obesity
  - Immune Deficiency
- High Blood pressure. Lowers HLD
- When in march people are forced to sleep less in the US due to daylight savings, there is a rise in heart attacks the following morning.
- And then again when people get an extra hr in November. The heart attack rates plummet.
- The less you sleep the more likely you are to eat and the affected metabolism won't be able to regulate the blood sugar. Hence you will gain weight and develop a risk of type 2 diabetes.
- The hormone insulin triggers the absorption of blood glucose from the cells. Being sleep-deprived affects insulin secretion and absorption. But the effect on the latter is much more pronounced.
- The body has two hunger-related hormones. One signals that we are full and is called leptin and the other signals we are hungry and is called ghrelin. Sleep deprivation decreases leptin and increases ghrelin. Hence it is kind of double jeopardy. The body is punished twice for the same crime and sleep deprivation will cause overeating.
- Not only will you overeat. You will prefer high-calorie foods with a lot of sugar and salt content. Similar to the craving for munchies after weed.
- As the prefrontal cortex is affected, good judgment is affected and your brain will become primitive and try to consume as much of the available calories as possible.
- Sleep loss affects testosterone levels and ages a man by 10-15 years in terms of testosterone virility.
- Symptoms of low testosterone like
  - Feeling tired and fatigued throughout the day
  - Difficulty with focus.
  - Low libido
  - Low bone density.
  - Difficulty in building muscle mass.
-  Women are equally affected
   -  The hormone-related to follicular release before ovulation and necessary for conception drops.
   -  Increases the probability of abnormal menstrual cycles.
   -  Decreases the probability of pregnancy.
   -  Increases the probability of miscarriages in the first trimester.
-  Think of the couple who is not sleeping well and then think about their chances of conceiving.
-  Sleep loss also affects immunity. 
-  Sleeping better also makes the body respond better to vaccines by generating a good amount of antibodies. Important to sleep well the day you got the vaccine shot.
-  Due to immunity issues, the body's killer cells don't work and are not able to clean the cancerous cells, and chances of cancers increase. Night shift jobs are hence carcinogenic.
-  DNA and gene mutation are also possible because of sleep deprivation, 
    


## How and why we dream
### Chapter 9: Routinely Psychotic

- Opposed to NREM sleep when compared to the wakeful state there is less activity in the brain, in REM the activity is more than the wakeful state.
- The theory given by Freud is not scientific. It can neither be proved nor disproved. According to Freud, dreams are nothing but a manifestation of our hidden desires. In other words, dreams are for wish fulfillment. But the desires don't manifest themselves as they are. They disguise themselves. And they do so because if the desires were presented as it is then the dreamer would be shocked and would wake up. Hence the desires are disguised or encrypted. They cannot be decrypted until you have the key. Freud claimed he had the key.
- The problem with the Freudian theory is that the interpretations were as generic and horoscopes are. And there was no logical pathway from the dream to the desire. Hence the theory cannot be proved and cannot be disproved.
- Freud's only contribution was that he suggested dreams originate within the brain. Before that dreams were considered something which was influenced by God and deities.
- It is not true that recent events have a high probability of appearing in dreams. Although there is a high probability that the emotional themes in the dreams are the emotions we have experienced during the day or recently.
- The regions active in the brain during REM sleep are as follows
  - The region responsible for complex visual perceptions. The back of the brain ie. 
  - The motor cortex. Responsible for instigating movements.
  - Hippocampus, the short-term memory device that stores the memories of the day until we sleep.
  - Amygdala, the region responsible for emotions
  All these regions are 30% more active when compared to their activity in the wakeful state.
- The far end and the far right regions of the prefrontal cortex, the place where we place our fingers when we are disappointed, show less activity. This is the region responsible for rational thought and logical decision-making. They can be considered deactivated and hence, logic is thrown out of the window.
- Monitoring the activity in the brain regions one can tell, what kind of dream someone is dreaming. Emotional, physical, etc.
- Through supervised learning that is by asking people what did they see and mapping it with the brain activity we can predict what did the person see. For example, a car or a garden, etc.
- Journaling our waking thoughts, feelings, concerns, and our dreams is a useful thing to do. As Socrates shared, A meaningful, healthy psychological life is an examined one.


### Chapter 10: Dreaming as overnight Therapy

- It was long thought that dreams were simply epiphenomena(by-product) of REM sleep. But that is not the case.
- To prove this a simple logic was used. First list down the benefits provided by REM sleep. Then try to predict from the content of the dreams what REM benefits were received by subjects. If the content of the dreams provides us with this predictive power then we can say that REM sleep is not enough on its own to provide those benefits. We need to see specific kinds of dreams to avail of those benefits.
- Using the above framework two core benefits of REM sleep were found
  1. Dreams as overnight therapy, ie. Dreams nursing emotional and mental health.
  2. Problem solving and creativity
- REM sleep and dreaming help with emotional health by divorcing the stress from the emotions of the experiences. Thus it takes the edge off.
- The edge is taken off by suppressing the release of noradrenaline during REM sleep. This then forces a kind of emotional replay without the stress.
- This hence helps us be more emotionally mature and deal with our emotions in a better way. So in a way, it is not time that heals all wounds. It is time spent in REM sleep that heals all wounds.
- In an interesting experiment, people who were showing signs of depression due to being in tough emotional situations such as breakups/divorces were asked to submit their dream reports. The researchers sifted through them to find out who were dreaming about the same emotional themes as their real-life and those were not. After a year all of them were reassessed and it was found that people who were dreaming about their tough emotional experiences a year ago had completely recovered and hence had no signs of depression.
- PTSD: Mostly seen in war veterans. They complain about reliving the experiences in dreams. It turned out that in PTSD condition the brain was not able to block the release of noradrenaline during REM sleep. Hence they were not able to learn to deal with those emotions. And brain knowing that they have not yet learned tried to show them the same dream time and again. Giving them a drug that helps block the release of noradrenaline, they were able to dream about the same emotional experience and eventually get over it.
- Dreaming also retunes (just like a musical instrument) daily our ability to understand facial expressions. If we are deprived of REM sleep then friends seem foes. We err on the negative side. We gain this retuning ability around adolescence.


### Chapter 11: Dream creativity and dream control

- Dreams promote creativity and problem-solving capabilities.
- Daily learning creates small clusters of a graph. All the information we have collected so far forms a forest of various connected components. Dreams connect these connected components. It also performs a path compression in the connected components and thus finds connection in the pieces of information and learnings we have accumulated to solve the problems we are currently focussing on. 
- This is the reason that many pioneers have stories where they were intensely working on a problem and the solution is presented to them in a dream. The book talks about various such examples including Mendeleev's discovery of the periodic table.
- People who were made to solve anagrams right after waking them up from REM sleep performed better compared to normal circumstances
- Not from the book: Zettlekasten works the same way.
- Content of the dreams is important for creative success. This was proven via an experiment where subjects were asked to solve a virtual maze for some time and then given break time. Half the participants were sent to sleep and half were made to see a video. The sleeping participants were woken up from time to time and were asked the content of the dreams they were in. After waking up all the participants returned to the virtual maze. The participants who slept performed better. The participants who dreamt of the maze performed even better.
- Not from the book: I used to see chess in my dreams when I initially started playing chess. Many times I have dreamt of solving math puzzles after writing the maths exam.
- Dream is what translates knowledge to wisdom.
- Hence the phrase sleep on it. The phrase interestingly exists in many languages around the globe
- Edison knew the power of dreams. He used to sleep knap during the daytime while sitting on a chair with steel balls in his right hand and a steel bucket under his right hand. As he would enter the REM stage his muscles would relax, the balls would fall on the bucket and he would wake up and immediately write down his creative ideas on a piece of paper kept on the desk in front of him.
- Lucid dreaming: Lucid dream occurs the moment one realizes he/she is in a dream.
- It was difficult to prove the claims of lucid dreaming. But an experiment in 2013 proved it. Participants who claimed could lucid dream were made to clinch their right and left fist while they were awake and the brain activity was recorded. Then they went to sleep and enter the REM stage. The fact they were dreaming could be verified from the relaxed muscles (atonia) and their brain wave pattern. As the eye movement is not blocked under REM sleep paralysis, the lucid dreamers were told to signal their dream awareness via a three-time left side eye movement. Then in their dream, they clenched their right fist and left fist. The fist itself won't show the movement of course because of the sleep paralysis but the brain activity was similar to what was recorded while they were awake.
- 20% of people can lucid dream and it is yet unclear whether it is beneficial or not.

## From Sleeping pills to a society transformed

### Chapter 12: Sleep Disorders
 - There are more than 100 known sleep disorders. This chapter covers a few of them
 - For advice on sleep disorders visit USA's [National Sleep Foundation](https://www.sleepfoundation.org)
 - This chapter will cover somnambulism, insomnia, narcolepsy, and fatal familial insomnia

#### Somnambulism
- Sleepwalking, sleep talking, sleep eating, sleep texting, sleep sex and sleep homicide(very very rare) come under somnambulism
- These events happen under NREM, not in REM as is popularly believed
- The brain activity is the same as in NREM. The body then only can perform rehearsed movements.
- Sleepwalking is common. More common in children as compared to adults.
- The famous case of [Kenneth Parks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_v_Parks) who sleepwalked to kill his in-laws and while coming back woke up and surrendered.
- Most somnambulistic episodes are considered benign and medicine only interferes when a family member's sleepwalking poses a risk.

#### Insomnia

- Most common sleep disorder
- People suffering from insomnia are not able to generate sleep of sufficient quality/quantity even if they give themselves enough sleep opportunity (7-9hrs)
- Some people feel they are going through insomnia but they are not. On monitoring, they sleep well. This is called paradoxical insomnia
- There are two types of insomnia
  - Sleep onset insomnia: Difficulty falling asleep.
  - Sleep maintenance insomnia: Difficulty staying asleep.
- For a diagnosis of insomnia following conditions should be met
  - Dissatisfaction with sleep quantity(difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, early morning awakening)
  - Suffering significant distress or daytime impairment
  - Insomnia for at least three nights each week for more than three months.
  - Does not have any coexisting medical conditions that could otherwise cause what appears to be insomnia
- Sleeping pills are rarely the right answer. A better solution would be presented in further chapters
- Insomnia is almost twice as common in women as in men
- African Americans and Hispanics appear to have higher rates of insomnia compared to Caucasians
- External factors which can cause insomnia are too much bright light at night, the wrong ambient room temperature, caffeine, tobacco, and alcohol consumption. If these causes are removed insomnia will go away.
-  Internal causes can be genetics, emotional worries, anxiety.
  

#### Narcolepsy

- It is a neurological disorder
- The body is always in the midpoint of sleep and wakeful condition. Hence weird things happen
- The condition usually emerges between the ages of 10 and 20.
- Symptoms
  - Irresistible urge to sleep during the day. So strong that the patient feels like he has been sleep-deprived for three days.
  - Frequent Sleep Paralysis
  - Cataplexy: Complete loss of muscle control, collapsing like a puppet when the string is cut, just like sleep paralysis but while being awake and conscious. This happens when the patient feels positive and negative emotions.
- This happens because the switch that the brain has which turns off while we sleep and turns on when we wake up, is half turned on and half turned on in this condition.
- The treatment outlook is bleak in narcoleptic patients and there is no treatment in sight. The only option is controlling emotions.

#### Fatal Familial Insomnia

- The famous case of [Michael Corke](https://www.world-of-lucid-dreaming.com/the-man-who-never-slept.html) who suddenly couldn't sleep and died in 10 months because of total sleep deprivation.
- This happens because of a gene anomaly and is genetically inherited.


- Sleep deprivation will eventually cause death and this generally happens because the immune system gets very weak and the bacteria in our intestine will start attacking our body.


### Chapter 13: What's stopping you from sleeping

#### Light
- Being exposed to light in the evening tricks our brain into believing that the sun is not set yet. Hence melatonin is not secreted in good amounts.
- Incandescent light is bad. LED light/ blue light is worse. And staring at the screen just before sleeping is worst. Even kindle has the blue light but way less compared to cell phones and tabs. Reading before bed should be done from a physical book.
- Light is the reason it takes time for us to fall asleep. After the room is dark, it takes around 20 minutes for the brain to secrete enough melatonin to generate sleep.
- Steps to improve the situation:-
  - Have dim lights in the rooms where you spend the evening hours
  - Avoid bright overhead lights.
  - Yellow tinted glasses
  - Install software on your devices to unsaturate the blue light

#### Alcohol
 - Alcohol is a sedative. It works by reducing brain function and starts with the pre-frontal cortex. Hence we lose inhibitions.
 - Alcohol fragments sleep. Hence the sleep is not continuous and as a result not restorative. The sleeper doesn't know about the nighttime awakenings.
 - Alcohol is also one of the most potent suppressors of REM sleep.
 - Due to this, [delerium tremens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delirium_tremens) can be caused. This is hallucinations and disorientation during the day.
 - Whatever we learn during the day is integrated during REM sleep. It takes weeks to cement the learning. But drinking alcohol makes us lose the learnings to a certain extent. Learn something on Monday, go for drinks on Friday and 40% of your learning may be gone.
 - The only solution is drinking during the daytime, so by sleep time, you are out of the effects of the alcohol, or pure abstinence.

#### Temperature

- Although underappreciated, temperature plays an important role.

### Chapter 15: Sleep and Society

- Number of People who are sleeping only 6hrs or less around the week and trying to catch up on the weekends are shooting up around the world.
- But we already know from the prior parts of this book that the brain can never fully catch up on lost sleep.
- A good night's sleep increases productivity. But people who trade sleep for work are praised and rewarded.
- Under-slept employees are not only less productive, less motivated, less creative, and lazier but they are also more ethical(as their prefrontal cortex is tired their impulse control is hampered).
- Supervisors who sleep less are short with the employees are disengaged, which results in the employees also getting disengaged.
- Under-slept leaders seem less charismatic and under-slept employees perceive their superiors as less charismatic than they are. If the boss and employees both are underslept the perceived charisma of the leader is badly affected.
- Sleeping better increases your money-making prospects due to increased performance.
- Companies like Nike and Google realize the importance of sleep and have flexible schedules and sleep pods in the office.
- NASA discovered that short naps of around 26 minutes and increase the performance by 34 percent.
- Sleep loss is used as torture by military and government agencies. The author voiced his concerns against that. Sleep is a basic necessity like food and water. 
- It has been found out by research studies conducted among various schools and a lot of twin studies that kids who sleep better get more intelligent as they grow up and have better IQs. Hence early start times of school are a bad thing for society as a whole. We are stopping the kids from realizing their complete potential. 
- A study conducted in the 1960s aimed to disrupt the REM sleep of some school kids for 7 days straight found out that it only took three days for the kids to exhibit psychotic symptoms. In three days the kids became moody, anxious and started to hallucinate. Paranoia took over them and they thought that the researchers are from a secret government agency that is trying to kill them.
- Kids sleep deprived because of early start times will be irritable, moodier, distractible, and unfocused. Without the info that they are sleep deprived the doctorS will diagnose them for ADHD. He will then prescribe Adderall/Ritalin which are high-powered addictive drugs that cause dependency and the kid is then badly affected. Because of these drugs, the kid's restorative sleep quality will be further affected and it will go on in a loop.
- The benefits of late school start times are many. Better attendance, better academic performance, reduces behavioral and psychological issues, and decreases substance and alcohol use. Late start times also mean late end times, which means kids are not left alone at home while the parents are at work and hence are better monitored. 
- School bus schedules and bus unions are major hurdles in fixing this. Also, the need of the parents to get kids out of the house and start their work early is another such need.
- In health care too, the budding medical professionals are required to work 30 hrs shifts and consequently, they make mistakes. They are a threat to themselves and their patients. It should be mandated that a medical professional awake for the past 16 hrs is not fit to treat/operate on patients. It is like letting drunk medical professionals treat patients. As their learning years are also impacted by this sleep deprivation and the problem becomes even worse.
