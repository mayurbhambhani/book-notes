# Why We Sleep

## Chapter 1- To Sleep…

The author talks about how he went into sleep research. It started with his research on predicting what kind of dementia a person will develop in future by observing the brainwave patterns during sleep.

## Chapter 2 Caffeine, Jet Lag and Melatonin.

Here we learn about circadian rythm which is our biological clock. This clock is around 24 hrs 15 minutes long. This circadian rhythm is regulated by melatonin which is produced by the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the brain, which calibrates your body clock using the amount of light. Hence melatonin is released at night and this tells your body its time to sleep. It just signals it, it does not generate sleep itself. Hence sleeping pills which induce melatonin secretion only give your body a night time signal. Those pills wont generate sleep but they aim to generate a melatonin generated placebo. When we are sleeping melatonin concentration decreases and is gone with the morning sunlight which is detected even when our eyelids are closed.

Jetlag is a problem because your circadian rythm takes time to adjust to the new time of sunlight to dark.
Jet lags are worse when we travel to east. Did not understand the logic though. 


There is another chemical which helps us sleep. Its called Adenosine. The more its concentration in the brain the more sleepy will feel.. The mode sleepy we feel. Circadian rhythm and Adenosine are independent. But they are aligned. 

Caffeine works by blocking the effects of adenosine. However adenosine keeps accumulating throughout the caffeine induced wakefulness and as the effects of caffeine wear off, we again feel sleepy. 
Caffeine has an ave half life of 5-7 hrs in the body. Hence a Coffee in the evening wont let you sleep on time. Even Decaf has 30% coffee. Thus, coffee is only suitable once i.e. in the morning.

The circadian rhythm is a wake drive signal and the adenosine is a sleep drive signal. If you plot these two signals on a graph where x axis represent time. Then the urge to sleep can be measured by the distance between the two signals. This distance is zero in the morning and highest in the night. The high point varies from people to people. Some people are early riser and some are late bloomers. Late bloomers will struggle through their life because the world accepts them to rise early.

#### Signs of insufficient sleep
Cant wake up w/o alarm clock.  
Can sleep again around 11.  
Re-reading the same sentence on the digital screen.   
There is a questionnaire included in the book.  


##Chapter 3: Defining and Generating Sleep

This chapter talks about REM(Rapid Eye Movement) and NREM(non-REM).
The sleep is an alternating cycle between these two where in the beginning of the sleep NREM takes major time of the cycle and vice versa in the end.
NREM is further dissected into 4 stages. Stages 3-4 are deep sleep stages.
REM is where dreams happen and the body is completely paralyzed.
During NREM brain wave has a regular wave pattern. Think of a stadium where all people are neurons. When all are chanting together the sound pattern would resemble brain wave pattern during NREM.
During REM the brainwave pattern is not distinguishable from wakeful brain wave pattern. But the eyes move rapidly from left to right and the muscles are completely relaxed(floppy, atone.).

Think of wakeful state as reception state. Where brains receives the information and stores into the main memory.

NREM state processes this data and transfers the skills and information in long term memory.
REM state is the integration where this new raw ingredients are connected with each other and the past.


##Chapter 4: Who sleeps, How do we Sleep and How Much

1. Without exception every animal studied to date sleeps or engages in something remarkably like sleep.
2. Sleep among all organisms differ in 4 ways .Daily duration , amount of REM sleep, the way we sleep(humans lie horizontally, some animals sleep on tree), Change of sleep patterns under rare circumstances( fasting makes us sleep less, some migratory birds can stay sleep deprived for a longer time while migrating ).
3. If we loose some sleep by pulling an all-nighter one night or not completing our complete sleep on a particular day. We don’t get that back. It is just lost.
4. How should we sleep. Biphasic. 8 hrs in the night and 60-90 minutes nap during the day.
5. Humans sleep in REM stage 25% of their sleep time. The whole animal kingdom aves 9%.
6. For some birds or animals, the left and right half of the brains can take turns to sleep. This is called uni-hemispheric sleep. Humans have a very mild version of it. It only happens when we sleep in unfamiliar environments. One half of the brain sleeps a little lighter than the other. Thats why first night in the hotel the quality of sleep is not so great.
