### Chapter 1- To Sleep…

The author talks about how he went into sleep research. It started with his research on predicting what kind of dementia a person will develop in future by observing the brainwave patterns during sleep.

### Chapter 2 Caffeine, Jet Lag and Melatonin.

Here we learn about circadian rythm which is our biological clock. This clock is around 24 hrs 15 minutes long. This circadian rhythm is regulated by melatonin which is produced by the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the brain, which calibrates your body clock using the amount of light. Hence melatonin is released at night and this tells your body its time to sleep. It just signals it, it does not generate sleep itself. Hence sleeping pills which induce melatonin secretion only give your body a night time signal. Those pills wont generate sleep but they aim to generate a melatonin generated placebo. When we are sleeping melatonin concentration decreases and is gone with the morning sunlight which is detected even when our eyelids are closed.

Jetlag is a problem because your circadian rythm takes time to adjust to the new time of sunlight to dark.
Jet lags are worse when we travel to east. Did not understand the logic though. 


There is another chemical which helps us sleep. Its called Adenosine. The more its concentration in the brain the more sleepy will feel.. The mode sleepy we feel. Circadian rhythm and Adenosine are independent. But they are aligned. 

Caffeine works by blocking the effects of adenosine. However adenosine keeps accumulating throughout the caffeine induced wakefulness and as the effects of caffeine wear off, we again feel sleepy. 
Caffeine has an ave half life of 5-7 hrs in the body. Hence a Coffee in the evening wont let you sleep on time. Even Decaf has 30% coffee. Thus, coffee is only suitable once i.e. in the morning.

The circadian rhythm is a wake drive signal and the adenosine is a sleep drive signal. If you plot these two signals on a graph where x axis represent time. Then the urge to sleep can be measured by the distance between the two signals. This distance is zero in the morning and highest in the night. The high point varies from people to people. Some people are early riser and some are late bloomers. Late bloomers will struggle through their life because the world accepts them to rise early.

#### Signs of insufficient sleep
Cant wake up w/o alarm clock.  
Can sleep again around 11.  
Re-reading the same sentence on the digital screen.   
There is a questionnaire included in the book.  


### Chapter 3: Defining and Generating Sleep

This chapter talks about REM(Rapid Eye Movement) and NREM(non-REM).
The sleep is an alternating cycle between these two where in the beginning of the sleep NREM takes major time of the cycle and vice versa in the end.
NREM is further dissected into 4 stages. Stages 3-4 are deep sleep stages.
REM is where dreams happen and the body is completely paralyzed.
During NREM brain wave has a regular wave pattern. Think of a stadium where all people are neurons. When all are chanting together the sound pattern would resemble brain wave pattern during NREM.
During REM the brainwave pattern is not distinguishable from wakeful brain wave pattern. But the eyes move rapidly from left to right and the muscles are completely relaxed(floppy, atone.).

Think of wakeful state as reception state. Where brains receives the information and stores into the main memory.

NREM state processes this data and transfers the skills and information in long term memory.
REM state is the integration where this new raw ingredients are connected with each other and the past.


### Chapter 4: Who sleeps, How do we Sleep and How Much

1. Without exception every animal studied to date sleeps or engages in something remarkably like sleep.
2. Sleep among all organisms differ in 4 ways .Daily duration , amount of REM sleep, the way we sleep(humans lie horizontally, some animals sleep on tree), Change of sleep patterns under rare circumstances( fasting makes us sleep less, some migratory birds can stay sleep deprived for a longer time while migrating ).
3. If we loose some sleep by pulling an all-nighter one night or not completing our complete sleep on a particular day. We don’t get that back. It is just lost.
4. How should we sleep. Biphasic. 8 hrs in the night and 60-90 minutes nap during the day.
5. Humans sleep in REM stage 25% of their sleep time. The whole animal kingdom aves 9%.
6. For some birds or animals, the left and right half of the brains can take turns to sleep. This is called uni-hemispheric sleep. Humans have a very mild version of it. It only happens when we sleep in unfamiliar environments. One half of the brain sleeps a little lighter than the other. Thats why first night in the hotel the quality of sleep is not so great.



### Chapter 5

#### Sleep Before Birth
- Most of the time is spent in sleep.
- Babies kick because during REM sleep the brain can not paralyse the body because the part of the brain responsible for sleep paralysis is not developed yet.
- Only in the final trimester, there is 2-3 hours wakefulness.
- In the last two weeks, the REM sleep increases. About 9-12 hrs a day is spent in REM sleep.
- A lot of neural connections are generated in the brain during the last bout of REM sleep. This phase is called synaptogenesis. Think of REM sleep as in Internet Service Provider that provides new neighbourhoods of the brains with vast networks of fibre optic cables. Everything is connected to everything and there is a lot of redundancy
- If this REM sleep is distrubed then there are very bad consequences. Hence mothers should not consume alcohol.
- In infant stages also REM sleep is very important. Giving alcohol to babies can lower the quality of REM sleep and hence can have long lasting impacts.


#### Childhood sleep
- Infants sleep in a polyphasic manner as oppsed to monophasic manner used by adults.
- A good funny book on the above phenomena is Go the Fuck to Sleep. Audio version is even better it seems. Its narrated by Samuel Jackson
- With every year the nightime sleep increases and the infant goes towards the monophasic sleep pattern. The circadian rythm is said around 4.
- The NREM/REM sleep ratio is around 50/50 in first 6 months. Around 5 the REM sleep decreases and the ratio becomes 70/30. Later in life this ratio is stablised to 80/20 in favor of NREM and stays there for the rest of the life.

#### Sleep Adoloscence
- As we saw that during initial stages of brain the internet service provider everything with everything, but this is not a good long term strategy, some connections in the brain need higher bandwidth and some dont need any bandwidth at all. So between the initial stage of life and adoloscence after getting enough statistic the ISP then rearranges the connections to be more efficient. This happens during the NREM sleep during adoloscence and hence the NREM sleep increases during adoloscence and after this synaptic pruning comes down to its natural levels.
- This synaptic pruning starts from the backside of the brain , the area responsible for vision and perception and ends at the front, the area responsible for rational thought and hence rationality is amongs the last brain functions that gets developed in the brain and hence teenagers are mostly irrational.
- Hence in adoloscence the deep sleep or NREM sleep provides necessary neural pruning.
- If this pruning doesnt happen properly then there is a risk of schizophrenia and other psychatric disorders
- The circadian rythm of a child runs on an earlier schedule and the circadian rythm of a teenager runs on a later schedule. And hence teenager have the tendency of staying up late. The worst part is they will sleep late and their dads will wake them up early in the morning thinking their kids are lazy. This interrupts the important pruning phase. Although in early adulhood it becomes normal


#### Sleep in middle life and old age

- Older adults need less sleep is a myth.
- They are just not able to generate the sleep they need.
- Them not getting enough sleep contributes to the ageing.
- As we go to late 20s and 30s, a decline in deep sleep is observed, both in quantity and quality.
- By the age of 70 we loose 80% of the sleep our young minds enjoyed.
- Sleeping pills are not a good solution.
- The older we get the more our sleep is fragmented, and hence the quality of sleep is not that great.
- Elders should also take care while going to bathrooms during the night due to fragmented sleep and bladder problems. The mind is not completely efficient and is groggy when they wake up during the night and thus they run a risk of falling down. They should always turn on the lights and give their brain a chance to collect itself before getting up from the bed. They should sleep by a nightime light. Have motion sensed light in the bathroom if possible. They should remove obstacles and rugs on their way from bed to the bathroom and there should be a phone by their bed for emergencies.
- Another issue with sleep in old age is that of circadian rythm. This change asks for an earlier bed time. Hence evening naps are to be avoided.
- Circadian rythms can be changed via
  - In the morning always wear googles when going into the sunlight.
  - In the late afternoon go out in the sunlight, wear had and sunscreen if required but dont wear googles.
  - Older adults can also consider taking melatonin pills. Only after consulting with doctors.
- The reason deep sleep declines in older age is that the parts of the brain responsible for generating the deep sleep degenerate the first. 
- As deep sleep is important for cementing facts and muscle memory older people become forgetful.




### Why we dream
### Chapter 9 : Routinely Psychotic

- Opposed to NREM sleep where compared to wakeful state there is less activity in the brain, in REM the activity is more than the wakeful state.
- The theory given by Freud is not scientific. It can neither be proved nor disproved. According to freud, dreams are nothing but manifestation of our hidden desires. In other words, dreams are for wish fullfilment. But the desires dont manifest themselves as they are. They disguise themselves. And they do so because if the desires were presented as it is then the dreamer would be shocked and would wake up. Hence the desires are disguised or encrypted. They cannot be decrypted until you have the key. Freud claimed he had the key.
- The problem with Freud theory is that the interpretations were as generic and horroscopes are. And there was no logical path way from the dream to the desire. Hence the theory cannot be proved and cannot be disproved.
- Freud's only contribution was that dreams originate within the brain. Before that dreams were considered something which were influenced by God's and dities.
- It is not true that recent events have high probability of appearing in dreams. Although there is a high probability that the emotional themes in the dreams are actually the emotions we have experienced during the day or recently.
- The regions active in the brain during REM sleep are as follows
  - The region responsible for complext visual perceptions. The back of the brain ie. 
  - The motor cortex. Responsible for instigating movements.
  - Hippocampus, the short term memory device which store the memories of the day until we sleep.
  - Amygdala, the region responsible for emotions
  All these regions are 30% more active when compared to their activity in the wakeful state.
- The far end and the far right regions of the prefont cortex ,the place where we place our fingers when we are dissapointed, show less activity. This is the region responsible for rational thought and logical decision making. They can be considered deactivated and hence, logic is thrown out of the window.
- Monitoring the activity in the brain regions one can tell, what kind of dream someone is dreaming. Emotional, physical etc.
- Through supervised learning that is by asking people what did they see and mapping it with the brain activity we can predict what did the person see. For example, a car or a garden etc.
- Journaling our waking thoughts, feelings , concerns and our dreams is a useful thing to do. As Socrates shared, A meaningful, healthy psychological life is an examined one.


### Chapter 10: Dreaming as overnight Therapy

- It was long thought that dreams were simply an epiphenomena(by-product) of REM sleep. But that is not the case.
- To prove this a simple logic was used. First list down the benefits provided by the REM sleep. Then try to predict from the content of the dreams what REM benefits were recieved by subjects. If the content of the dreams provides us with this predictive power then we can say that REM sleep is not enough on its own to provide those benefits. We need to see specific kind of dreams to avail those benefits.
- Using the above framework two core benefits of REM sleep were found
  1. Dreams as overnight therapy, ie. Dreams nursing emotional and mental health.
  2. Problem solving and creativity
- REM sleep and dreaming help with emotional health by divorcing the stress from the emotions of the experiences. Thus it takes the edge off.
- The edge is taken off by supressing the release of noradrenaline during REM sleep. This then forces a kind of emotional replay without the stress.
- This hence helps us be more emotionally mature and deal with our emotions in a better way. So in a way it is not time tha heals all wounds. It is time spent in REM sleep that heals all wounds.
- In an interesting experiement, people who were showing signs of depression due to being in tough emotional situations such as breakups/divorces were asked to submit their dream reports. The researchers sifted through them to find out who were dreaming about the same emotional themes as their real life and those were not. After an year all of them were reassessed and it was found that people who were dreaming about their tough emotional experiences an year ago had completely recovered and hence had no signs of depression.
- PTSD: Mostly seen in war veterans. They complain about reliving the experiences in dreams. It turned out that in PTSD condition the brain was not able to block the release of noradrenaline during REM sleep. Hence they were not able to learn to deal with those emotions. And brain knowing that they have not yet learnt tried to show them the same dream time and again. Giving them a drug which helps block the release of noradrenaline, they were able to dream about the same emotional experience and eventually get over it.
- Dreaming also retunes (just like a musical instrument) daily our ability to understand facial expresssions. If we are deprived of REM sleep then friends seem foes. We err on the negative side. We gain this retuning ability around adoloscence.
