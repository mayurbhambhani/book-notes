# Managing Humans

## Part 1: The Management Quiver

- Much of management is about solving problems
- One of your job is to figure your manager out. What does he want, How does he deal with a crisis, and how does he communicate. Understanding your manager gives you a lot of tools to do your job better.

### Chapter 1: Don't Be A Prick

- Understand the people that work with you. Continuously assess what they need and how are their needs changing with time and the changing nature of the org. 
- Understanding people is what will make you phenomenal.
- Fulfilling individual's needs is one way to keep them content and productive.


### Chapter 2: Managers Are Not Evil

- Some questions which team members need to ask themselves to figure out whether their manager can/will look out for them.
- Where do they come from: Team members should make sure their manager understands what they do. To make sure they do, they need to understand how to convey it to the managers. If the manager comes from QA, they have to speak QA.
- How is the manager Compensating for His Blind spots: Is he relying on experts or trying to hire them for areas he is deficient with.
- Can he communicate to other managers, up the org, and to you properly. Is he able to handle all local dialects and can put across his points clearly and effectively. Does he regularly talk to important people and his team members?
- He should not be a pure delegator. He should be able to do real work.
- He should do what he says he is going to do. He should take visible action. He should make things happen.
- Where does he belong in the food chain. How people talk to him during the cross-functional meetings. Do they know him, is his opinion respected? If it is his meeting does he drive it? Is he well informed? Only then he will be able to draft out a strategy to best represent his team when changes are about to happen.
- How does he react during tough situations. This will tell you if he is an asshole and when you should be concerned about yourself.
- Does he know where he is going. Is he ambitious?

### Chapter 3 - Rands Test

- Just like the [Joel's Test](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/) to rate the quality of a software team, Rands Test is supposed to help us to rate the communication health of the org.
- Less than 8 on this test is a problem.

#### Do you have a 1:1?(+1)
- It should be regular.
- It should be strategic.
- If you are not taking it seriously then you are just enforcing the myth that managers are out of touch.

Do you have a team meeting? (+1)
- Kill lies
- Measure tangible progress.
- Fix broken things

Are handwritten status reports delivered weekly via emails(-1)
- The culture should be to use the collaboration tools like Jira, to understand the status.
- Writing email statuses or confluence docs or excels is just a lack of imagination and a lack of trust.

Are you comfortable saying no to your boss? (+1)
- If people above you are open to feedback and suggestions it is a good sign.


Can you explain the strategy of the company to a stranger(+1)
- Information is key. Don't be out of touch. 

Can you explain the current state of the business? (+1)
- If you gave a point to yourself in the last question you just need to make sure that the steps the org is taking are in the right direction.
  
Does the guy/girl in charge regularly stands up in front of the group and tell you what he/she is thinking? (+1) Are you buying it? (+1)
- Is there an all-hands, do you agree with the views expressed? What does that say about the state of business

Do you know what you want to do next? (+1) Does your boss? (+1)
- You will be able to sort useful info from garbage if you have clarity. If your boss understands the trajectory he will also be able to use the info to help you.

Do you have time to be strategic(+1?
- You know your next move. Are you thinking strategy to get there? Can you point towards your calendar and show when are you being strategic?

Are you actively killing the grapevine(+1)
- Lack of information forces people to make up shit.
- Diffuse it, call it nonsense if it sounds like it. 


### Chapter 4: How To Run A Meeting

- Two types of meetings
  - Alignment Meetings
    - Information exchange
    - Tactical
    - Regular cadence
  - Creation meetings
    - Solve a problem.
- There are two important components every meeting should have
  - An agenda- Share in an email before the meeting or start the meeting with it.
  - A referee- Ensures the progress is being made and the meeting is on the agenda. Also makes sure that people are not checked out. If they are, pulls them back in by directing a question to them or resetting the meeting by silence or drawing attention somehow. This person also strikes a balance between shutting down the rambling and recognize productive ramblings. This guy also needs to capture action items and recap the meeting in the follow-up. A successful meeting never occurs again.
- Meeting management like people management is an art of managing a moment. The action depends on the context.
