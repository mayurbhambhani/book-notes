# Managing Humans

## Part 1: The Management Quiver

- Much of management is about solving problems
- One of your job is to figure your manager out. What does he want, How does he deal with a crisis, and how does he communicate. Understanding your manager gives you a lot of tools to do your job better.

### Chapter 1: Don't Be A Prick

- Understand the people that work with you. Continuously assess what they need and how are their needs changing with time and the changing nature of the org. 
- Understanding people is what will make you phenomenal.
- Fulfilling individual's needs is one way to keep them content and productive.


### Chapter 2: Managers Are Not Evil

- Some questions which team members need to ask themselves to figure out whether their manager can/will look out for them.
- Where do they come from: Team members should make sure their manager understands what they do. To make sure they do, they need to understand how to convey it to the managers. If the manager comes from QA, they have to speak QA.
- How is the manager Compensating for His Blind spots: Is he relying on experts or trying to hire them for areas he is deficient with.
- Can he communicate to other managers, up the org, and to you properly. Is he able to handle all local dialects and can put across his points clearly and effectively. Does he regularly talk to important people and his team members?
- He should not be a pure delegator. He should be able to do real work.
- He should do what he says he is going to do. He should take visible action. He should make things happen.
- Where does he belong in the food chain. How people talk to him during the cross-functional meetings. Do they know him, is his opinion respected? If it is his meeting does he drive it? Is he well informed? Only then he will be able to draft out a strategy to best represent his team when changes are about to happen.
- How does he react during tough situations. This will tell you if he is an asshole and when you should be concerned about yourself.
- Does he know where he is going. Is he ambitious?

### Chapter 3 - Rands Test

- Just like the [Joel's Test](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/) to rate the quality of a software team, Rands Test is supposed to help us to rate the communication health of the org.
- Less than 8 on this test is a problem.

#### Do you have a 1:1?(+1)
- It should be regular.
- It should be strategic.
- If you are not taking it seriously then you are just enforcing the myth that managers are out of touch.

Do you have a team meeting? (+1)
- Kill lies
- Measure tangible progress.
- Fix broken things

Are handwritten status reports delivered weekly via emails(-1)
- The culture should be to use the collaboration tools like Jira, to understand the status.
- Writing email statuses or confluence docs or excels is just a lack of imagination and a lack of trust.

Are you comfortable saying no to your boss? (+1)
- If people above you are open to feedback and suggestions it is a good sign.


Can you explain the strategy of the company to a stranger(+1)
- Information is key. Don't be out of touch. 

Can you explain the current state of the business? (+1)
- If you gave a point to yourself in the last question you just need to make sure that the steps the org is taking are in the right direction.
  
Does the guy/girl in charge regularly stands up in front of the group and tell you what he/she is thinking? (+1) Are you buying it? (+1)
- Is there an all-hands, do you agree with the views expressed? What does that say about the state of business

Do you know what you want to do next? (+1) Does your boss? (+1)
- You will be able to sort useful info from garbage if you have clarity. If your boss understands the trajectory he will also be able to use the info to help you.

Do you have time to be strategic(+1?
- You know your next move. Are you thinking strategy to get there? Can you point towards your calendar and show when are you being strategic?

Are you actively killing the grapevine(+1)
- Lack of information forces people to make up shit.
- Diffuse it, call it nonsense if it sounds like it. 


### Chapter 4: How To Run A Meeting

- Two types of meetings
  - Alignment Meetings
    - Information exchange
    - Tactical
    - Regular cadence
  - Creation meetings
    - Solve a problem.
- There are two important components every meeting should have
  - An agenda- Share in an email before the meeting or start the meeting with it.
  - A referee- Ensures the progress is being made and the meeting is on the agenda. Also makes sure that people are not checked out. If they are, pulls them back in by directing a question to them or resetting the meeting by silence or drawing attention somehow. This person also strikes a balance between shutting down the rambling and recognize productive ramblings. This guy also needs to capture action items and recap the meeting in the follow-up. A successful meeting never occurs again.
- Meeting management like people management is an art of managing a moment. The action depends on the context.

## Part 3: Versions Of You

### Chapter 28: Bored People Quit

- People want to quit because they are bored. You can make them stay but the battle is already lost.
- Boredom should be detected and fixed asap.
- Techniques for detecting boredom
  - Changes in routine: coming late, going early
  - Productivity decrease
  - Ask them. Go beyond what they are saying. They might not realize it yet that they are bored. Better to find out before they do.
  - They might not exactly tell you that they are bored. But they might say, that they don't know what next.
- Fixing boredom
  - Boredom or not, a manager should know where their employees want to reach.
  - They should also know what are they doing to get them there.
  - Figure out what technical aspect or what part of the technical problem the team is solving they like
  - Give them time to work on it and reduce interruptions
  - If anyone asks for a justification of the bandwidth loss, inform them that product building is not your only responsibility. You also build people.
  - Regularly tell them that you know where they want to reach and you are thinking about how to take them there.
  
  ### Chapter 29: Bellwethers

  - This chapter talks about hiring.
  - Hiring anyone is a risk. Its important that a wildly different set of people interview the candidate to get a lot of perspectives. This goes back to the basic assumption of author that a decision always becomes better if multiple people are examining it.
  - According to author everyone on the team should interview the candidate.
  - There should be go to set of interviewers for judging different aspects of the candidates. We need bellwethers for technical skills, cultural fit(team and company) and vision(strategic and tactical).
  - Technical: Find a technical bully
  - Vision: Do we want someone to push an agenda or work in silence. And how is the candidate matching our requirements.
  - Always listen to the teams feedback. Always conduct a debrief and let the group reach consensus.

### Chatper 30 : The 90 Day Interview

- It takes time to get adjusted in a new job. It takes time to understand the jargons, the tech and most importantly people. According to the auther you should give 90 days to complete this process.
- When you join a company. Set a reminder in the calendar after 90 days. This physical act reminds you to relax and not fret. Some things take time.
- Stay Late and Show up Early: Understand the working time of your team members. How they work and what is their process. Helps to understand your team better
- Accept Every lunch interview you get. You need to build rapport.
- Always ask about acronyms. The team has its jargon. Listening wont help until you understand these jargons.
- Dont be afraid of stupid questions. Let the team giggle. The should know you are trying to get the drift and dont like to lift any opportunity to understand things.
- Have a Drink. Whenever invited dont miss the opportunity to socialize out of work. Real stories are shared there.
- After the rapport is build the following three can be tried.
- Tell someone what to do. The goal is to exert your influence and test your influence. The goal is also to see what you say is true. Is your understanding of the organization correct. Tell the right person
- Have an argument. To figure out how are decisions taken and arguments resolved. Are healthy arguments the norm or emotions get into it and arguments end with grudges.
- Find your inner circle. After 90 days you hayouve a reading of where you belong and are comfortable.
- Finish: Develop an understanding of the people. Understand how to interact with each individuals keeping in mind their quirks.

### Chapter 31: Managing Nerds

- Your job with your nerd team member is to bring calm to their chaos.
- Nerds love consistency. There should be a logic to everything decision that makes further such decisions predictable.
- Nerds love efficiency. Ensure that they are not disturbed then they are in the zone. Give them an environment where they can be productive.
- Understand what are the things which can make them more productive. Give them the setup they need. Find out the visual cues that can tell the world they are in the zone and should not be disturbed. Headphones on, sitting in a particular room, having a coffee cup nearby.
- If your nerd tells you he can build it himself. Ask him to justify it. Your default position should be avoiding the reinventing of the wheel.
- Nerds get bitter when we see the same mistakes repeating themselves. Ask them, understand the mistakes and the solutions if they are proposing any.
- If they appear stuck with a task, talk to them. Do they need help? If they do pair them with a non-competitor senior team member who can help them.
- Don't try to force them into the zone. Provide the environment and let them be. Pair them with a cohort if letting them be doesn't work.

### Chatper 32: NADD

- Nerd attention deficit disorder.
- Did not understand the point of this chapter.
- Talks about how nerds can focus on different things at a time and the might seem distracted but thats how they work

### Chapter 33: Nerd Cave

- What I took out of this chapter was the importance of a structured process to get you in the productivity zone
- Have a routine and process to get into the groove. Also described in [Atomic Habits](atomic%20habits.md). For example, wake up, take a shower, have cornflakes while reading the news, and get into it.
- Importance of a designated place where you do your thinking.
- Importance of a door or headphones to keep out the rest of the world.
- It should also have a comfortable chair, desk, table, laptop, and internet.
- Sometimes you won't go into the zone, but maintain the routine, do something else in the same place maintaining the same meeting. This is like going to the gym because you want to get better at cricket.


### Chatper 34: Meeting Creatures.

- The Anchor: The most important guy. Everybody is talking to this guy. They want his opinion and he would make decisions. If he is not present reschedule. Time is being wasted.
- Laptop Larry: Trying to work in the meeting. Neither works nor listens properly. Most unproductive. If he is taking notes tell him that a designated person is taking notes and he doesn't need to. Else he will look at Wikipedia to search what something means. He should be asking people, listen intently and debate on things.
- Mr. Irrelevant: Who invited him and why? Find out before punting him.
- Chatty Patty: Cant close a thought. Rambles on. Should only be asked where well-defined questions where the scope for him to drone on is less. Find out if this person is irrelevant.
- Translator Tim: Bridges two groups who don't understand each other. The important guy only when he favors your agenda. Else you will have to find your own Tim.
- Sally Synthesizer: Always listens and moves the meeting forward by making the obvious, crystal clear with other people. Same as in the case of Tim, if Sally is not on your side, find your own Sally. Make sure she doesn't start thinking she is an anchor.
- Curveball Kurt: You don't know what he is talking about. Take help from Sally and Tim, if required, and figure out if he is Mr. Irrelevant. The situation is going to be tough when Anchor=Kurt.
- The Snake: The hidden Anchor. For some reason, this guy was hidden and somebody else was acting as anchor.

### Chapter 35: Incrementalists and Completionists

- Incrementalists: Realists. Understand that everything cant be done the right way because we dont have enough time. Always make small progress. But these people lack vision and a holistic picture. We also need to make sure that their incremental tasks are going towards actual completion and there solutions should just not tackle the symptoms but they should move towards actual solution.
- Completionists: Dreamers. Want to do things right and dont want to compromise even when there is a deadline. Have vision but lack fast action. While working with them we continuously need to focus on the fact that better is the enemy of done. 
- It isnt a battle of wrong vs right it is the battle of right vs right.
- Whenever there is a conflict between two such people. Find middle ground by marrying both the strategies

### Chapter 36: Organics And Mechanics

- This chapter talks about understanding how your manager things and works and use that knowledge to communicate with them.
- Mechanics: Structured approach. Systematic collection of information. Might seem uptight.
- Organics: Will seem like their approach is chaotic and they are improvising. Though they are better at networking and chill people.
- As a manager strive to marry these two things to create your approach.

### Chapter 37: Inwards, Outwards, Holistics

- Inwards: First line manager, Small teams. Have to worry only about their own team and the product they make. They worry about cross functional stuff only when other teams are dependent on their teams. Myself
- Holistics: Directors. Have an org to manager. Most of the time goes in info gathering. Difficult to get their time. Have hired good Inwards to manage the separate orgs. They need to know what is happening everywhere in the org
- Outwards: Pradhan. Worry about how company is percieved publically, customers, finances. They tell other people about what great work is being done. While holistics run the company, these guys are accountable.
- Not understanding what you are might result in micro management.
- While hiring inwards its good to hire inwards on a trajectory to become holistics.

### Chapter 38: Free Electrons

- People who can be brought in to provide dev help to any project.
- Highly intelligent and efficient developers who can act as saviors.
- These are rockstars.
- How to take care of them?
  - Keep them engaged: Give them research-oriented tasks. If they spend too long in development they will get bored.
  - See that they are not writing the whole DB layer to fix a mess only to realize later that we don't have the testing capacity to test the new layer.
  - Sometimes they won't engage and they won't explain why. Think you telling them to fix something which is urgent and them saying yes to it and not doing anything until two weeks later the problem vanishes on its own.
  - Don't give them extra special attention in front of the team. You don't say in front of the team that so and so is a free electron. They already know.


### Chapter 39: Rules for the Reorg.

- Reorg is when teams or products are shifted around to align with the new company strategy. It can be because the market is changing, the vision is changing or they brought a fancy new CEO who saw things differently.
- Figure out your role in the reorg. You can use it as an opportunity to facilitate team changes which without the already happening reorg would have sounded absurd. Or you can decide to sit back and watch the fun.
- Start listening carefully. Rumors will be spread. Kill the grapevine and don't believe everything you hear.
- Reorgs take forever. It is not over until the org char has been presented to the entire company.
- Have patience. Things will take time to settle down. And shifted teams and their head will take time to get used to the change.

### Chatper 40: An Unexpected Connection

- Useless chapter. Just describes why and how nerds are funny.
- They are funny because they create real-time humor by connecting things.
- Hence they have a huge knowledge appetite. So they can connect things.

### Chapter 41: Avoiding the Fez

- Fez represents an engineer who doesn't want to grow.
- He has stuck around by creating dependency for too long and sooner or later people will remove the dependency by taking initiative. If he is maintaining a bad code base that only he understands. It would be rewritten.
- Don't be a Fez. Don't be in the state where you are given projects which nobody cares for. Don't be the fat that is trimmed when times become testing for the org.
- Convince the Fez to put his faith in growth rather than the comfort of the known.
- Annual review is important. Every month write about what the team did and how the people performed. By the end of the year, you will have enough career guidance advice for your team.
- Annual review is a discussion, not a speech
- Every employee is in a 2X2 matrix. One axis is Skill and the other is Interest. 
  - High Skill, High Interest
    - They will eventually leave this state but this is the desirable state.
  - High Skill, Low Interest
    - They are bored. Keep them engaged. Needs change in responsibility and scenery.
  - Low Skill, High Interest
    - Send them on training, Help them. mentor them
  - Low Skill, Low Interest
    - Improving skill improves interest and vice versa.

### Chapter 42: A Glimpse And A Hook

- Return to the chapter when writing resumes
- Recruiters look for keywords
- Hiring Managers look for what you worked on during the first pass.
- They will glance where you studied in the second pass. To avoid bias.
- The resume should withhold an information test.
- It should be very easy to read at a glance. Don't give any minute detail
- It should stand out without being very bold. 
-

### Chapter 43: Nailing the Phone Screen

- Prepare your questions
- As a Hiring Manager,  see if communication is not a problem and the questions the candidate asked are well prepared.
- As an HM, start with some interesting detail you found in the resume. Infy Mysore, Some college project. etc, City, School college, etc.
- As an interviewee: If you are in the ballpark of required skills it's good enough, don't even worry about good to have skills.
- Google the guy who is going to interview you
- Google the company and product.
- Do at least 1-hour research and prepare the questions you want to ask.
- As an HM:
  - Look for long awkward pauses
  - Adversarial interactions
  - How did it feel.
  

### Chapter 44: Your Resignation Checklist

- Don't over-commit in the notice period because of the guilt
- Personally inform people you respect and like that you are leaving.
- Update the list of the people you will call back when you start up your own thing.
- Don't write angry-hate-revenge mails. Don't burn the bridges. Be nice.
- Do right by those who work for you. Send them a separate email that has their strengths and working areas.
- Don't volunteer to do work after you leave. If we do charge a lot of money.
- Don't give too much notice. Just the bare minimum. Give them the chance to move on.
