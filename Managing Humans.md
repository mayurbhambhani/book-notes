# Managing Humans

## Part 1: The Management Quiver

- Much of management is about solving problems
- One of your job is to figure your manager out. What does he want, How does he deal with a crisis, and how does he communicate. Understanding your manager gives you a lot of tools to do your job better.

### Chapter 1: Don't Be A Prick

- Understand the people that work with you. Continuously assess what they need and how are their needs changing with time and the changing nature of the org. 
- Understanding people is what will make you phenomenal.
- Fulfilling individual's needs is one way to keep them content and productive.


### Chapter 2: Managers Are Not Evil

- Some questions which team members need to ask themselves to figure out whether their manager can/will look out for them.
- Where do they come from: Team members should make sure their manager understands what they do. To make sure they do, they need to understand how to convey it to the managers. If the manager comes from QA, they have to speak QA.
- How is the manager Compensating for His Blind spots: Is he relying on experts or trying to hire them for areas he is deficient with.
- Can he communicate to other managers, up the org, and to you properly. Is he able to handle all local dialects and can put across his points clearly and effectively. Does he regularly talk to important people and his team members?
- He should not be a pure delegator. He should be able to do real work.
- He should do what he says he is going to do. He should take visible action. He should make things happen.
- Where does he belong in the food chain. How people talk to him during the cross-functional meetings. Do they know him, is his opinion respected? If it is his meeting does he drive it? Is he well informed? Only then he will be able to draft out a strategy to best represent his team when changes are about to happen.
- How does he react during tough situations. This will tell you if he is an asshole and when you should be concerned about yourself.
- Does he know where he is going. Is he ambitious?
