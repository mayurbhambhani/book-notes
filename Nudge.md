# Nudge

### Introduction

- Liberterial Paternalism. This is the central idea of the book. Nudging people in the right direction without compromising freedom of choice.
- Whenever a system is designed certain factors will present choices to its user. A choice architect is a person who is, knowingly or unknowingly, responsible for the arrangement of those choices. Depending on the default option a lot of user behavior is influenced.
- Example: Amsterdam airport men urinals have a fly sticker in them. This simple change made men aim better and decreased the mess by 80%
- Example: The way the food is arranged or displayed in the cafeteria can be used to influence kids to choose healthy foods. 
- The libertarian view is that people are capable to choose well for themselves. This is where we can make a discussion between humans and econs.
- An econ is someone that has access to all relevant data, is very intelligent, and has a lot of willpower. This person will always make informed and rational decisions. The decisions might be wrong, but they would be unbiased and will be always systematically wrong in a predictable direction.
- But humans are not econs, we have emotions, flaws, and impulses. 
- Humans have a strong tendency to go with the status quo or default option. Humans have status quo bias which is a fancy name for inertia.
- A nudge is any factor that would significantly alter human behavior but won't affect econs.
- To count as a nudge the intervention must be easy and cheap to avoid. Putting healthy foods in the cafeteria at eye level counts as a nudge, banning junk food does not.
- Humans make good decisions when they have experience, good information, and prompt feedback eg choosing icecream flavors
- Humans make bad decisions when they are inexperienced, have bad or no information and the feedback loop is very slow: eating healthy
- There is no way we can make choices that won't influence people in a certain way.
- So instead of coercion or forcing people to choose what is best for them, we can nudge them in the right direction without eliminating freedom of choice.
