# Nudge

### Introduction

- **Liberterial Paternalism**. This is the central idea of the book. Nudging people in the right direction without compromising freedom of choice.
- Whenever a system is designed certain factors will present choices to its user. A choice architect is a person who is, knowingly or unknowingly, responsible for the arrangement of those choices. Depending on the default option a lot of user behavior is influenced.
- Example: Amsterdam airport men urinals have a fly sticker in them. This simple change made men aim better and decreased the mess by 80%
- Example: The way the food is arranged or displayed in the cafeteria can be used to influence kids to choose healthy foods. 
- The libertarian view is that people are capable to choose well for themselves. This is where we can make a discussion between humans and econs.
- An econ is someone that has access to all relevant data, is very intelligent, and has a lot of willpower. This person will always make informed and rational decisions. The decisions might be wrong, but they would be unbiased and will be always systematically wrong in a predictable direction.
- But humans are not econs, we have emotions, flaws, and impulses. 
- Humans have a strong tendency to go with the status quo or default option. Humans have status quo bias which is a fancy name for inertia.
- A nudge is any factor that would significantly alter human behavior but won't affect econs.
- To count as a nudge the intervention must be easy and cheap to avoid. Putting healthy foods in the cafeteria at eye level counts as a nudge, banning junk food does not.
- Humans make good decisions when they have experience, good information, and prompt feedback eg choosing icecream flavors
- Humans make bad decisions when they are inexperienced, have bad or no information and the feedback loop is very slow: eating healthy
- There is no way we can make choices that won't influence people in a certain way.
- So instead of coercion or forcing people to choose what is best for them, we can nudge them in the right direction without eliminating freedom of choice.

## Part 1: Humans And Econs

### Chapter 1: Blunder And Biases

- Like the book Thinking Fast and Slow, this book also uses two systems concept to describe intuitive decisions and calculative decisions. To me, it feels like that the calculative system is the heuristic approach or a rule-based approach. And the intuitive approach is the ml-based approach. Just like the ml model predictions, it is difficult to explain why the decision was made when it's intuitive. In this book, System 1 or intuitive system would be called **Automatic System** and the rule-based system or System 2 will be called **Reflective System**.
- **Automatic System**: Uncontrolled, effortless, Associative, Fast, Unconscious, Skilled.
- **Reflective System**: Controlled, effortful, Deductive, Slow, Self-aware, Rule-following.
- Good players know that to play good that will have to practice a lot and will have to use Automatic System. The reflective system should not be used much. "Trust the gut" and "just do it".
- **Rules of Thumb**: These are decision shortcut ml models used by our brain to make decisions easily. This helps because the world is complex and these rules of thumbs act as shortcuts and thus, reduce loads on our brain. Although these are useful, their use can lead to systematic biases. These biases have been described the detail in the Thinking Fast and Slow book. 
- **Anchoring**: When the brain is exposed to a question, the answer of which it doesn't know, then it starts with a question, the answer to which it does know, and then adjust in the direction it thinks appropriate. For example, if someone asks you the population of Indore. You might start with the population of Dewas and then increase it based on the size ratio of Dewas and Indore. So basically you start with what you know and then you make changes according to the problem posed. The place where you start is called the ***anchor*** and the changes are called ***adjustments***. The problem with this approach is that sometimes obviously irrelevant anchors creep into the decision-making process. For example, the order of the following questions have significant changes in the answers
  - How happy are you?
  - How often are you dating/making love
- And this is why people asking for donations give us options like 500, 1000, 2000, 5000. Because these options act as anchors.
- **Availability**: Events, for which we have ready examples available in our memory are judged to be more probable than they are. If there has been recently an earthquake, there would be a spike in the number of people buying earthquake-related insurance. The judged probability is even higher if we have experienced the event. This is called the availability heuristic. We assess the likelihood of the risks by asking ourselves how readily the examples come to mind. Homicides are more available than suicides so people wrongly assume that more people die from homicide.
- **Representativeness** : Similarity heuristic. When asked what is the probability of A belonging to class B, we ask ourselves how similar is A to B. Biases can creep in with this approach because people don't consider, what is the probability that a random item belongs to class B. If a girl looks like a librarian, to determine the probability that she is, we should consider what percentage of girls are librarians. This also causes us to detect patterns in random events. If a fair coin gives heads on consequent three tosses, we tend to think something is wrong with the coin. People watching sports also believe in hot streaks without considering regression to the mean.
- **Optimism And Overconfidence**: People are unrealistically confident with their abilities and scenarios concerning them, even after they know the real probability of success in a particular scenario. This is how new restaurant owners answer the following questions
  - What is the success rate in the restaurant business? A: 50%
  - What is the probability of you succeeding? A: 90%
- **Gains and Losses**: People, in general, are risk-averse. Roughly speaking, losing something makes you twice as miserable as gaining the same thing makes you happy. This can be measured by a simple gambling question. Let's toss a coin and I will give you $X if it is heads. If it is tales you give me 100$. What should be the value of X for you to take the gamble. If this question is asked to a lot of people, the average hovers around 200$. Hence, loss aversion produces inertia. If we wear to lose what we have, we don't make trades that we would have otherwise made. Just like every other bias, this helps sometimes and is not helpful sometimes.
- **Status Quo Bias**: Inertia. This is what stops people from opt-out from data collection by social media websites. One cause is lack of attention or the yeah whatever attitude.
- **Framing**: Our responses change to a question or a request based on how it was framed. If a patient is told the operation success rate is 90% he might opt for it, but if you tell him 10 dies if the operation is performed on 100 people, even a doctor might reject it.


### Chapter 2: Resisting Temptation
- People are dynamically inconsistent.
- People decide to refrain from harmful activities in the cold state and do the same thing in the hot state.
- It's easy to think about this if we think the guy planning in the cold state is the planner and the guy doing the bad things is the doer.
- People can't resist temptation because they think their willpower can control the doer.
- Will power is a bad measure, the planner has to establish unbreakable processes. 
- Some examples given in the book are
  - Two friends can bet against each other that if any one of them doesn't meet their weight target, they will pay the other once 25k. 
  - Research mentors can ask their Ph.D. students to hand them checks which the mentors can check out if the students are not knocking off the chapters on time.
  - Piggybank: The planner can put money in every day but the doer cannot take it out when required.
  - Mental accounting: Having different accounts for savings and spending helps.


### Chapter 3: Following the herd.

- Why social influence or social poof mentioned in [Influence](Influence-%20The%20Psychology%20of%20persuasion.md) works and how can it be used to nudge people in the right direction.
- Like described in the [Influence](Influence-%20The%20Psychology%20of%20persuasion.md) book. The tendency to follow others increases when we are unsure.
- Research has shown even for easy tasks, like comparing two identical lines, 20-40 percent can be swayed if the rest of the room is unanimously reporting that line A is greater than line B.
- Smiles are contagious, Yawns are contagious, Laughter tracks in comedy shows work, and husband and wife start to look alike( mostly because of imitation of facial expressions, also same diet and food habits). Also, couples who start to look alike tend to be happier.
- Social influences come into two basic categories, Information and Peer Pressure. Information when you don't know what to do and you tend to follow other people. Peer pressure when you do things in fear of getting criticized or to fit in.
- Conformity experiments: Experiments that illustrate that people sometimes will abandon reason to conform with the unanimous view. Line A - Line B experiment is one example. If people in such experiments are asked to give anonymous answers, reason rather than peer pressure has a better chance.
- In uncertain situations, the voice which is sure, articulate, and confident will prevail and will sway the group unanimously towards itself. Once the group agrees on an opinion they will keep the same view even after that unfaltering voice has gone and new people have joined the group. And this will eventually become a tradition without anyone knowing the reason. This is then **Pluaralistic Ingorance**, also described in the Social Proof chapter of [Influence](Influence-%20The%20Psychology%20of%20persuasion.md) that's how tradition works. The only way a tradition is removed is by clearly pointing out when it is harmful. If there is uncertainty in the logic then the tradition will stay.
- Conformity can be used to nudge people in the right direction. If govt wants people to exercise more, just mentioning that a lot of people are exercising will have an effect.
- "Don't Mess With Texas". The stop littering campaign by the Texas government which showed sportsmen picking up littering and saying 'don't mess with texas' gained great popularity
- Reporting on boards that "70% teenagers in the city are smoke-free" will help a lot in discouraging young people from smoking.
- **The Spotlight Effect**: The reason we want to conform with other people is that we think other people care and are paying attention. They are paying less attention than we perceive. But we tend to believe that the spotlight is on us. An experiment which involved making participants wear T-shirts with negatively popular celebrities' face resulted in participants thinking a bit less than half people would pay attention but in reality only 20% did.
- Obesity is contagious, you are more likely to get fat if all your friends are getting fat or are fat. Dining with other people is also a sure-shot way of gaining weight.
- Conformity and Tax Compliance: If people are told that 90% public is tax compliant. They want to get compliant too.
- So the point is if you want to nudge people in the positive direction, you talk about how others are already doing the positive thing. And don't tell them at any cost their current actions are better than the social norm.
- Parents also use the same technique. They tell their kids how other kids behave properly and they should too.
- **Priming**: Asking questions to gain commitment. If you ask people that are they planning to eat unhealthy this week then their affirmative response will increase the food choices they are going to make. Results would be even better if they are asked about the specifics. For example, how are you going to eat healthily, what items are you going to choose as your diet? In case of asking about exercising, one can increase the level of commitment by simply asking when and where do they plan to exercise. Hence, the nudge provided by asking them what to do can be enhanced by asking them how they plan to do it.
- Information, Peer pressure, and Priming can be effectively used as social nudges.
