# Nudge

### Introduction

- **Liberterial Paternalism**. This is the central idea of the book. Nudging people in the right direction without compromising freedom of choice.
- Whenever a system is designed certain factors will present choices to its user. A choice architect is a person who is, knowingly or unknowingly, responsible for the arrangement of those choices. Depending on the how the options are structured/arranged, a lot of user behavior is influenced.
- Example: Amsterdam airport men urinals have a fly sticker in them. This simple change made men aim better and decreased the mess by 80%
- Example: The way the food is arranged or displayed in the cafeteria can be used to influence kids to choose healthy foods. 
- The libertarian view is that people are capable to choose well for themselves. This is where we can make a discussion between humans and econs.
- An econ is someone that has access to all relevant data, is very intelligent, and has a lot of willpower. This person will always make informed and rational decisions. The decisions might be wrong, but they would be unbiased and will be always systematically wrong in a predictable direction.
- But humans are not econs, we have emotions, flaws, and impulses. 
- Humans have a strong tendency to go with the status quo or default option. Humans have status quo bias which is a fancy name for inertia.
- A nudge is any factor that would significantly alter human behavior but won't affect econs.
- To count as a nudge the intervention must be easy and cheap to avoid. Putting healthy foods in the cafeteria at eye level counts as a nudge, banning junk food does not.
- Humans make good decisions when they have experience, good information, and prompt feedback eg choosing icecream flavors
- Humans make bad decisions when they are inexperienced, have bad or no information and the feedback loop is very slow: eating healthy
- There is no way we can make choices that won't influence people in a certain way.
- So instead of coercion or forcing people to choose what is best for them, we can nudge them in the right direction without eliminating freedom of choice.

## Part 1: Humans And Econs

### Chapter 1: Blunder And Biases

- Like the book Thinking Fast and Slow, this book also uses two systems concept to describe intuitive decisions and calculative decisions. To me, it feels like that the calculative system is the heuristic approach or a rule-based approach. And the intuitive approach is the ml-based approach. Just like the ml model predictions, it is difficult to explain why the decision was made when it's intuitive. In this book, System 1 or intuitive system would be called **Automatic System** and the rule-based system or System 2 will be called **Reflective System**.
- **Automatic System**: Uncontrolled, effortless, Associative, Fast, Unconscious, Skilled.
- **Reflective System**: Controlled, effortful, Deductive, Slow, Self-aware, Rule-following.
- Good players know that to play good that will have to practice a lot and will have to use Automatic System. The reflective system should not be used much. "Trust the gut" and "just do it".
- **Rules of Thumb**: These are decision shortcut ml models used by our brain to make decisions easily. This helps because the world is complex and these rules of thumbs act as shortcuts and thus, reduce loads on our brain. Although these are useful, their use can lead to systematic biases. These biases have been described the detail in the Thinking Fast and Slow book. 
- **Anchoring**: When the brain is exposed to a question, the answer of which it doesn't know, then it starts with a question, the answer to which it does know, and then adjust in the direction it thinks appropriate. For example, if someone asks you the population of Indore. You might start with the population of Dewas and then increase it based on the size ratio of Dewas and Indore. So basically you start with what you know and then you make changes according to the problem posed. The place where you start is called the ***anchor*** and the changes are called ***adjustments***. The problem with this approach is that sometimes obviously irrelevant anchors creep into the decision-making process. For example, the order of the following questions have significant changes in the answers
  - How happy are you?
  - How often are you dating/making love
- And this is why people asking for donations give us options like 500, 1000, 2000, 5000. Because these options act as anchors.
- **Availability**: Events, for which we have ready examples available in our memory are judged to be more probable than they are. If there has been recently an earthquake, there would be a spike in the number of people buying earthquake-related insurance. The judged probability is even higher if we have experienced the event. This is called the availability heuristic. We assess the likelihood of the risks by asking ourselves how readily the examples come to mind. Homicides are more available than suicides so people wrongly assume that more people die from homicide.
- **Representativeness** : Similarity heuristic. When asked what is the probability of A belonging to class B, we ask ourselves how similar is A to B. Biases can creep in with this approach because people don't consider, what is the probability that a random item belongs to class B. If a girl looks like a librarian, to determine the probability that she is, we should consider what percentage of girls are librarians. This also causes us to detect patterns in random events. If a fair coin gives heads on consequent three tosses, we tend to think something is wrong with the coin. People watching sports also believe in hot streaks without considering regression to the mean.
- **Optimism And Overconfidence**: People are unrealistically confident with their abilities and scenarios concerning them, even after they know the real probability of success in a particular scenario. This is how new restaurant owners answer the following questions
  - What is the success rate in the restaurant business? A: 50%
  - What is the probability of you succeeding? A: 90%
- **Gains and Losses**: People, in general, are risk-averse. Roughly speaking, losing something makes you twice as miserable as gaining the same thing makes you happy. This can be measured by a simple gambling question. Let's toss a coin and I will give you $X if it is heads. If it is tales you give me 100$. What should be the value of X for you to take the gamble. If this question is asked to a lot of people, the average hovers around 200$. Hence, loss aversion produces inertia. If we wear to lose what we have, we don't make trades that we would have otherwise made. Just like every other bias, this helps sometimes and is not helpful sometimes.
- **Status Quo Bias**: Inertia. This is what stops people from opt-out from data collection by social media websites. One cause is lack of attention or the yeah whatever attitude.
- **Framing**: Our responses change to a question or a request based on how it was framed. If a patient is told the operation success rate is 90% he might opt for it, but if you tell him 10 dies if the operation is performed on 100 people, even a doctor might reject it.


### Chapter 2: Resisting Temptation
- People are dynamically inconsistent.
- People decide to refrain from harmful activities in the cold state and do the same thing in the hot state.
- It's easy to think about this if we think the guy planning in the cold state is the planner and the guy doing the bad things is the doer.
- People can't resist temptation because they think their willpower can control the doer.
- Will power is a bad measure, the planner has to establish unbreakable processes. 
- Some examples given in the book are
  - Two friends can bet against each other that if any one of them doesn't meet their weight target, they will pay the other once 25k. 
  - Research mentors can ask their Ph.D. students to hand them checks which the mentors can check out if the students are not knocking off the chapters on time.
  - Piggybank: The planner can put money in every day but the doer cannot take it out when required.
  - Mental accounting: Having different accounts for savings and spending helps.


### Chapter 3: Following The Herd

- Why social influence or social poof mentioned in [Influence](Influence-%20The%20Psychology%20of%20persuasion.md) works and how can it be used to nudge people in the right direction.
- Like described in the [Influence](Influence-%20The%20Psychology%20of%20persuasion.md) book. The tendency to follow others increases when we are unsure.
- Research has shown even for easy tasks, like comparing two identical lines, 20-40 percent can be swayed if the rest of the room is unanimously reporting that line A is greater than line B.
- Smiles are contagious, Yawns are contagious, Laughter tracks in comedy shows work, and husband and wife start to look alike( mostly because of imitation of facial expressions, also same diet and food habits). Also, couples who start to look alike tend to be happier.
- Social influences come into two basic categories, Information and Peer Pressure. Information when you don't know what to do and you tend to follow other people. Peer pressure when you do things in fear of getting criticized or to fit in.
- Conformity experiments: Experiments that illustrate that people sometimes will abandon reason to conform with the unanimous view. Line A - Line B experiment is one example. If people in such experiments are asked to give anonymous answers, reason rather than peer pressure has a better chance.
- In uncertain situations, the voice which is sure, articulate, and confident will prevail and will sway the group unanimously towards itself. Once the group agrees on an opinion they will keep the same view even after that unfaltering voice has gone and new people have joined the group. And this will eventually become a tradition without anyone knowing the reason. This is then **Pluaralistic Ingorance**, also described in the Social Proof chapter of [Influence](Influence-%20The%20Psychology%20of%20persuasion.md) that's how tradition works. The only way a tradition is removed is by clearly pointing out when it is harmful. If there is uncertainty in the logic then the tradition will stay.
- Conformity can be used to nudge people in the right direction. If govt wants people to exercise more, just mentioning that a lot of people are exercising will have an effect.
- "Don't Mess With Texas". The stop littering campaign by the Texas government which showed sportsmen picking up littering and saying 'don't mess with texas' gained great popularity
- Reporting on boards that "70% teenagers in the city are smoke-free" will help a lot in discouraging young people from smoking.
- **The Spotlight Effect**: The reason we want to conform with other people is that we think other people care and are paying attention. They are paying less attention than we perceive. But we tend to believe that the spotlight is on us. An experiment which involved making participants wear T-shirts with negatively popular celebrities' face resulted in participants thinking a bit less than half people would pay attention but in reality only 20% did.
- Obesity is contagious, you are more likely to get fat if all your friends are getting fat or are fat. Dining with other people is also a sure-shot way of gaining weight.
- Conformity and Tax Compliance: If people are told that 90% public is tax compliant. They want to get compliant too.
- So the point is if you want to nudge people in the positive direction, you talk about how others are already doing the positive thing. And don't tell them at any cost their current actions are better than the social norm.
- Parents also use the same technique. They tell their kids how other kids behave properly and they should too.
- **Priming**: Asking questions to gain commitment. If you ask people that are they planning to eat unhealthy this week then their affirmative response will increase the food choices they are going to make. Results would be even better if they are asked about the specifics. For example, how are you going to eat healthily, what items are you going to choose as your diet? In case of asking about exercising, one can increase the level of commitment by simply asking when and where do they plan to exercise. Hence, the nudge provided by asking them what to do can be enhanced by asking them how they plan to do it.
- Information, Peer pressure, and Priming can be effectively used as social nudges.

### Chapter 4: When Do We Need A Nudge

- The goal of this chapter is: 
  - Specifying the kinds of situations in which people are least likely to make good choices.
  - Specifying when the free market forces and competition will exacerbate the human nature of making bad choices.

#### Situations that need a nudge

- Benefits now and costs later: Eating high-calorie foods, smoking, drinking are sinful goods. Excercise now and good health later are investment goods. Both investment and sinful goods are prime candidates for nudges.
- Degree of difficulty: When the problem at hand is a difficult one and there are no tools available for the automated best choice.
- Frequency: If the problem is hard, people can learn through practice. But are some important events that happen with very low frequency during a lifetime. Getting married, Choosing a career, etc. Due to low-frequency humans cant practice and hone the skill of making the right choices in such events. Hence then can use help in the form of a nudge.
- Feedback: Even if the frequency is high, one can only learn if they get feedback after every attempt. Ex. someone can eat a high-fat diet for years without having any warning signs until the heart attack.
- Knowing what you like: People can use a nudge in the right direction which they don't know which options they like. Choosing a mutual fund, choosing an insurance plan. When we don't know what is good for us we might appreciate a nudge.

#### Markets

- General assumption is the fair forces of the competition in the market will always make sure that consumers will get quality goods at competitive prices. But there are some cases where this logic doesn't apply. Take the example of a second-year warranty on a cell phone which costs 20% of the phone cost which let us say is $200. If the probability of the phone needing repair is 1% in the second year then by not taking the extended warranty the risk we are taking is just $2. But we are been asked to pay 20$ which is outrageous. And people buy these guarantees just because they don't want to feel sorry later. Market forces cant help in such cases, because it is not easy for a 3rd party to get into this agreement. Consumers then will need a nudge in the right direction.



### Chapter 5: Choice Architecture

- One factor to keep in mind when designing anything is that the signal the object gives should be consistent with the response. Ex. there should be no handles on the side of the door which is to be pushed. Handles should be there on the pull side. This is a failure of the architecture to accommodate the basic principles of human psychology. **Design of Everyday things** by Don Norman is a good book on the subject. The example of the four-burner stove is also mentioned. ![Burner](media/Four%20stove%20burner.jpg)

- The goal of this chapter is to highlight the importance of such thinking in choice architects. In particular, we don't want the Automatic System to get confused.
- Following ideas can help. Mnemonic: Nudges
  - I**N**centive
  - **U**nderstand Mappings
  - **D**faults
  - **G**ive Feedback
  - **E**xpect Error
  - **S**tructure complex choices

#### Defaults
- For multiple reasons which need nudges default help a lot.
- It is also important to note that all defaults are not selected to make the chooser's life easier/better. Ex. CCPA, magazine subscriptions
- We can skip the default and make the choice required or mandatory but in that case, there are two problems.
  - Required choosing is only good for simple yes or no choices
  - The illusion of choice is another burden the brain must bear.

#### Expect Error
- The design should account for human error and should be forgiving.
- The ATM design should be such that users cant forget their cards.
- The petrol/diesel cap should be attached to the car.
- The above-mentioned errors are called post-completion errors.
- Gmail reminds us that we mentioned an attachment but did not attach it.

#### Give Feedback
- Digital cameras provide a fake shutter click sound.
- Warning systems. Like laptops give low battery warnings. But the number of warnings should not be too high or the user will start ignoring the warnings.

#### Understand Mappings
- When people don't know what choice will translate to what mapping, people need a nudge.
- Good choice architecture in such cases improves the ability of the chooser to map between choices and outcomes and hence helped them make a better choice.
- If I am buying apple cider it helps to know that three apples will translate to one glass.
- Patients should get similar mappings which choosing treatment options for cancer. Surgery vs radiotherapy mappings.
- Instead of megapixels, cameras should tell you what is the maximum size of a photo you can produce.
- One technique to help people make better choices in case of mortgages, auto insurance plans, cell phones plans, and other similar problems is called RECAP
- **RECAP**: Record, Evaluate and Compare Alternative Prices.
- For cell phone markets, RECAP will work by making it mandatory for providers to send a detailed yearly report on the breakup of every penny charged. Automated tools then, can help consumers on how other providers would have charged for the same usage. Users can then decide to switch if possible.

#### Structure Complex Choices
- When there are fewer choices, brute force works for evaluation. For example, selecting out of three work locations an employer is providing. Just go to all three places and evaluate.
- But if there are a lot of choices then you try to reduce them by filtering based on criteria and then only evaluating the final one.
- In such cases, awesome alternatives run a risk of filtering out.
- People need help in such cases. This can be done by structuring the choices which make user decisions easier.
- Ex. Netflix recommendation systems.
- The color choosing palette in the drawing software. Instead of remembering the codes and trying them one by one user will be able to select easily.

#### Incentives
- The relation between the choice and incentive should be made salient(more noticeable).
- Phone displaying the cost of trunk calls as we are talking
- Calorie burning display while running.
- Apps that can predict and remind how your face will look like after 5 years of smoking.

## Part 2: Money

- Econs save better, spend and borrow thoughtfully, and invest better.
- Humans are not Econs.
- This part will tell use how private organizations and government can nudge people in the right ridrection

### Chapter 6: Save More Tomorrow

- The theory of saving for retirement is simple. Figure out when you are going to retire, figure out your expenses after retirement and start saving accordingly without sacrificing too much while they are working.
- Assuming that people can save for retirement assumes that
  - People can solve the complex mathematical problem of calculating how much money they will need.
  - They have enough willpower and discipline to execute the plan.
- Early pension schemes were defined-benefit plans. The pension you get was proportional to the salary paid in your last working years. The proportion depending on the number of years you worked there.
- Social security checks in America depend on the amount of tax you have paid in your working years. The payouts are adjusted for inflation
- These well-defined plans have one good virtue from the perspective of choice architecture. They are forgiving to even the most mindless of Humans. For social security checks, the only decision which needs to be made is when you are going to retire. The later you retire the bigger the checks. It might be a difficult decision but its just one decision
- Same for private defined-benefit plans also have the same advantage, as long as the worker keeps working for the same employer and the employer stays in business. But this doesn't work for workers who keep changing jobs. Generally, there is a minimum requirement of staying in the company for at least 5 years.
- Enters defined-contribution plans, where employee and sometimes employer(they sometimes match the contributions up to some threshold) put money regularly in a tax-sheltered account. These contributions are tax-deductible. The money in this account can be divided between savings and investments. The retirement savings then depend on how much was saved and investment returns. NPS, 401(k) etc.
- These plans are portable and the worker switching jobs won't result in losing this account.
- Although defined-contribution plans are flexible, they are not very forgiving from the choice architecture perspective. Employees have to:
  - Enroll
  - Decide how much to save and how much to invest
  - Maintain the portfolio for several years
  - Deciding what to do with the proceeds after retiring.
- People find the whole process frightening and seem to be messing this up. Sometimes employers match the contributions and thus by not taking advantage of this people are just losing free money.
- And surveys show that people want to save more and save systematically. But the task is daunting.
- Nudges can help in such a situation.
- Educating people on this topic is not proven to show significant improvements.
- Savings should be automatic or the default choice. Or when joining an organization the employee must choose to save or not.
- The saving rates should automatically increase as people get raises. This will solve the frustration of the immediate reduction in the in-hand salary when you decide to save more. It will also make the increase in savings gradual. After the savings reach a certain threshold percentage of salary(15% in the USA) of the salary, then don't increase more.
- The above-described plan is called **Save More Tomorrow**
- This works because
  - People want to save but don't follow through
  - Self-control restrictions are easier to adopt if they take place sometime in the future
  - Loss aversion. People hate to see their paychecks go down when they start saving.
  - Money Illusion. People don't adjust for inflation when thinking about savings.
  - Inertia plays a powerful role.
- Government can offer incentives to the employer to implement the Save More Tomorrow plan.
- Has been successfully implemented in many places in the US and has shown phenomenal results.
- To decide how much you can save find a calculator which asks questions on your lifestyle, health, salary, etc.


### Chapter 7: Naive Investing

- **Asset Allocation Decision**: Choosing an appropriate mix of bonds and stocks.
- Once you choose what percentage is going to go in stocks and what is going to a bank account you need to choose what stocks to buy.
- People don't generally pick stocks, they pick mutual funds which vary in terms of how risky they are and how much they charge for their services.
- There are also funds designed which combine stock and bonds.
- Then you also have to decide how much should one invest in his/her employers' shares.
- These are difficult choices. Choice architecture can help here.
- On the average market(S&P Index fund) returns an interest of 10.4 %. The average market return in India for NSE is around 17%.
- In economic jargons, stocks are referred to as equities.
- Although the average rate of return is high, there have been years when the market plunges by 30%.
- But if you are thinking long term, 20 years, then it should give 10%. Side Note: what happens the year you decide to retire, the stock market goes down. I guess you will have to wait for the market to catch up. Even if you don't, the savings should be decent enough.
- But assuming the worst possible and assuming that the market is going to betray you, how can you decide?
- This is how an Econ would make this decision. Whether the possibility of 25% richer is worth the risk of being 15% poorer.
- Even if Humans think about the problem in the same way they won't be able to make the necessary calculations. Then the decisions they do make will suffer from the following flaws
  - The decisions will be unduly(to an unwarranted degree) influenced by recent market fluctuations.
  - The decision will be likely based on rules of thumbs.
- **Influence Of Recent market fluctuations:**
  - Looking at the prices frequently: Over 20 years, stocks are almost certain to go up. In the US there is no 20 year period where stocks have declined in real value or have been outperformed by bonds. If the investors are shown the evidence on risks of stocks and bonds over a long period, such as 20 years, they choose to invest all their money in stocks. See Benartzi and Thaler (1999)
  - Market timing People generally buy high and sell low.
- **Rules Of Thumb:**
  - 1/n heuristic: If presented with n options Humans will equally allocate 1/n resources on each of those options. Sometimes companies would offer plans to the employees where the choice is made easy by offering lifestyle funds(conservative, moderate, aggressive). Or they might offer plans based on ages. But when much of these funds are offered people again use the 1/n rules. The fund itself does proper allocation and after choosing a particular fund the 1/n heuristic is not required. But people get confused.
  - Company Stock: People tend to invest more in company stock out of loyalty and confidence(due to past performance). But as this is not at all diversified this is a bad strategy. If the company goes down, salary and investments both will suffer. More than 10% of retirement money should not be invested in the company you work for.
- **Nudges required:**
  - Default: Enrollment should be by default. And a default strategy should also be present. Participants will just have to choose between aggressive, conservative, or a moderate strategy. Another choice of default is choosing a fund that matures the year this participant is going to retire.
  - Structuring Complex Choices: Lifestyle portfolios(conservative, moderate, aggressive), target maturity funds are good choices.
  - Expect Error: For people who don't join, automatic enrollment clubbed with Save More Tomorrow. The ratio between bonds and stocks by default would be adjusted over time in the automatically selected asset allocation.
  - Mappings and Feedback: People should be shown the houses that they can buy on retiring based on their current allocation. Then can then change if the house they see and the house they would want is not the same.

### Chapter 8: Credit Markets.

- The three common ways people borrow in the modern world 
  - mortgages
  - credit cards
  - student-loans

#### Mortgage
- Shopping for a mortgage used to be easy. There were only fixed-rate mortgages. Comparing them was easy. Just choose the one with the lowest interest rate.
- Now there are options to choose from various fixed-rate and variable-rate. Where the rate varies according to the movements in the market. Some loans are interest-only which means that the borrower makes no payment towards the principal and hence the loan is never paid off until the house is sold, or the loan is [refinanced](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tdmc/your-money/5-reasons-to-go-for-home-loan-refinance/articleshow/52293509.cms). Many variable-rate mortgages are further complicated by teaser rates this means that initially, the rates would be less but after one or two years the higher rates would kick in.
- Then there is the matter of fees. Which can vary greatly. Sometimes there is some payment which the borrower needs to pay to receive the lower interest rates. And there are pre-payment penalties that need to be paid when the loan is repaid early.
- Research shows that when the market gets more complicated, the unsophisticated and uneducated will be especially disadvantaged by the complexity
  - African-Americans and Latinos generally pay higher for loans.
  - People living in the uneducated neighborhood pay higher for loans.
  - Women pay more.
- Mortgage brokers who tend to rich clients have more incentive to establish fair dealings, mortgage brokers who deal with the poor are often looking for a quick buck.
- These factors are further exacerbated in subprime loans.
- ***Subprime Loans***:
  - Lent to people who are not eligible for conventional loans due to their low credit scores.
  - As lending to people with low credit scores is risky, these loans typically have high-interest rates to compensate for the risk.
  - These are mostly ARM(Adjustable Rate Mortgages), which means that the interest will increase at specified points in times.
  - 2008 financial crisis in the US was blamed on the subprime mortgages because in the years preceding the meltdown, a lot of subprime loans were offered to unqualified buyers.
- Subprime loans are both, good and bad.
- Good,  because we can't say subprime mortgages are bad because it helps poor to be homeowners.
- Bad, because subprime borrowers are often unsophisticated and they are sometimes exploited by the brokers.
- The truth or real assessment of these loans are buried in a mountain of fine print which subprime borrowers can not make sense of and hence they end up with loans that are less beneficial for them but more beneficial for the broker.
- This is called predatory lending.
- There can be paternalistic approaches to solve these problems.
  - The loan estimate presented by the broker must be valid for 30 days and the borrower must wait before purchasing
  - Limit the set of permissible mortgages and ban certain kind of mortgages like mortgages with negative amortization or balloon payments( in such mortgages large payments are due at the end because mortgage and interest haven't been fully paid over the term)
- Libertarian Paternalistic approaches offering a nudge can be the following two versions of the RECAP plan
  - The mortgage lenders would be required to report the lending costs in two components, fees and interest. The fee might have different components, which also should be reported, but all of it has to be added to one salient number. Now as the costs are separated, it is simpler for the borrowers to compare different loans as the interest rate is the only thing they have to look at. The interest rate disclosure should have a schedule of payments, so the borrowers know how much is due when. For market-dependent loans, the worst-case scenarios should also be added.
  - The mortgage lenders should also provide a machine-readable report for this. Hence various third parties(which can be easily regulated), can help people compare between different loans.

#### Student Loans

- In the US, there are two kinds of loans in the marketplace, federal and private.
- On both kinds of loans, the government pays the interest while the student is in college, acts as the guarantor if the student defaults, and subsidizes the loans. Lenders find making these loans highly profitable.
- Students typically try for a federal loan first as it's cheaper. Then they look at the private loans if necessary.
- The forms for federal loans are infamous for the overwhelming number of questions and their complexity. Students have to give their parents financial information, College Board financial aid profile( for private colleges).
- After the student submits the form the department of education decides how much the student's family can pay for the college(called the expected family contribution) and then the college decides the size of the loan.
- Alternatively, the student can go to private loans, by showing college enrollment proof. Unlike federal loans, the money can be used for anything and hence the loan lender or broker can encourage the borrower to borrow more and overspend.
- It is naive to ask your mortgage broker for advice. Similarly, it is naive to ask the college's advice on where to borrow. Because sometimes the college department in charge of this has colluded with the private loan lenders.
- Nudges that can help
  - Simplify the forms, don't ask for parents' financial info, get this info from the IT returns filed by the family. And make the forms similar for private and govt loans. So at least people don't go to private just to avoid complexity.
  - Machine-readable RECAP.
  - Encourage families to eliminate the need for loans together by helping them start college saving accounts. Provide an incentive in the form of seed money in that account.

#### Credit Cards

- The problem with a credit card that it is the opposite version of Save More Tomorrow. It is Spend today, Pay tomorrow. As the problem of paying is transferred to the future self, the current self loses self-control and ends up spending beyond his means and incurs debt.
- Credit card companies deliberately make it hard for people to set up automatic payments.
- Always pay the full amount. Never pay just the minimum. The rates are crazy, the fines are crazy, and even as a penalty, you might have to pay interest on the next month's purchases as well, from the date of purchase to the scheduled payment date.
- Libertarian Paternalistic solution. RECAP, usage report which leaves not even a single penny hidden.

### Chapter 9: Privatizing social security

- Bush proposed a plan in 2000 to privatize social security. Some part of the payroll income tax contribution of an individual can go to a savings account. From there, it could be invested in a fund. 
- Sweden implemented the plan. They gave a default fund. People could change. Any fund can enter the market if it fulfills certain fiduciary criteria. Citizens could select up to five funds.
- Funds were permitted to advertise.
- Government chose one fund as default, which was very well designed. It was diversified across, foreign stock, Sweden stocks, private equity, hedge fund, bonds. And 60% allocation from all assets classes was given to index funds. Which meant that less fund management cost and thus less fee.
- 1/3 of the people did not choose and thus stayed with the default one.
- The others who did choose, did not choose very well. Popular choices were those funds that performed very well in the recent past. But that doesn't give any forecasting ability on how the fund is going to perform in the future. As all this happened just before the dot com crash, at that time it seemed like a good idea to invest in tech. And that's how most people chose their funds.
- In summary, those who chose for themselves
  - Selected a higher equity exposure(96.8%)
  - More active management(very less in index funds)
  - Higher fee(because of active management)
  - Local concentration(half of the equity exposure was in the Sweden market). No foreign stocks. Not advisable as Sweden contributes only 1% to the world economy
- The default fund performed much better.
- The choice architects should have encouraged the people to stay with the default rather than taking a neutral stand.
- Advertizing was also not the proper way to inform people, because the firms will not nudge the people in the right direction but will just try to reel in customers. 
- The Swedish government should have said, you can choose your funds after expert advice, if you don't we have a very good expert-designed default fund for people just like you.


## Part 3: Health

### Chapter 10: Prescription Drugs: Part D for daunting

- This chapter describes what happened when the US decided to give prescription drugs coverage to its senior citizens
- Similar to the theme in the book It describes that to maximize choice the whole matter became very complicated and it was very difficult for seniors to choose a plan for themselves. There were a lot of private choices and no proper aid was provided.
- The enrollment was not automatic for people who currently were not associated with any other plan.
- For those who were able to automatically enroll, their default plan was chosen at random. Which is problematic on following accounts
  - Patient history was not taken into account. 
  - Seniors who got enrolled in medical plans which are expensive to them might stop taking the drug which will increase the cost to the government if their conditions worsen.
  - Seniors who don't need plans which are costing a little too much to the government will not change it due to inertia and status quo bias and hence govt again is unnecessarily paying extra costs.
  - The costs were medicines were always changing. Hence if someone, somehow, was able to make the right choice, it is not guaranteed that the choice will remain the right choice.
- Possible solutions to avoid these issues is better choice architecture.
- According to patient history, a plan should be recommended. In case the senior is already using a plan which is not as suitable as the default, they should be informed via mailers that better options exist.
- RECAP: Every year when the date to change plans approaches, the seniors should get a RECAP report which should also be machine-readable. They can then compare and choose.


### Chapter 11: How to increase organ donations

- With useful nudges, we can increase the number of organs available for patients in need.
- Explicit Consent: People don't register because of inertia and status quo bias
- Routine Removal: State can remove organs after death without need consent. This happens nowhere. In some states in the US though, practitioners are allowed to remove corneas without permission. That is the extent of it and that should be.
- Presumed Consent: By default, everyone is an organ donor. People can choose not to be. If the process to opt-out is minimal effort and very low cost then this comes under Libertarian Paternalism. Many countries in Europe have adopted this. In Austria, 99% of the people are organ donors. In Germany only 12. Presumed Consent is implemented in Austria and Explicit content in Germany
- Research shows that switching from explicit to presumed consent increases the donation rate in a country by 16%.
- Although the family can object after the donor is dead. And some countries like France give a lot of importance to it. But a system of presumed consent at least allows the hospitals to approach families as a family of a donor.
- Mandated Choice: Force people to choose when they apply for a new license. This also works better than explicit consent. And also the donor family has a high chance of readily complying because they should respect a decision that was explicitly selected.
- Although presumed consent and mandated choice is supposed to give better results, explicit consent if choice architected properly can be used to get good numbers. For example, Illinois implemented First Person Consent registry for organ donation. Family consent at the time of harvesting is not required if somebody registers.
- Online registration. The website describes how many people die yearly because organs are not available, then it describes how many people die in Illinois every year. Then it influences people by mentioning how many people have already signed up for this to use social proof. And then the website makes it easier for you to share your donation decision on social media websites.

### Chapter 12: Saving the Planet

- Government restrictions are one way to restrict pollution. Command and control reject free choices and markets entirely and allow people little flexibility in promoting environmental goals.
- Aggressive controls of new sources of air pollution can extend the life of old dirty sources and thus increase air pollution, at least in the short run.
- More often government don't specify the ways to reduce emission. They just require across-the-board reductions.
- Sometimes people do change, but sometimes they don't, or the cost of the change turns out to be very high and then the bureaucrats have to go back to work.
- The use of choice architecture might sound like a very mild measure against the consequences we are facing.
- But the problem with the environment can itself be thought of as something where global choice architecture, among other things, played a role.
- Incentives are not properly aligned. If you engage in environmentally costly behavior next year, through your consumption choices, you will probably pay nothing for the environmental harms you inflict.
- People do not get fast feedback on their environmental choices.
- By tuning these two aspects of choice architecture(incentive and feedback) we can nudge.

#### Better Incentives

- Two ways
- Impose tax and penalties on those who pollute.
- Cap-and-trade system. The government decides on how much pollution is tolerable. Which creates a region cap. Then based on this number people who pollute are given or sold rights to pollute in certain amounts. If they reduce their pollution or stop pollution, these people then can sell these rights in a market. Now they have a reason to reduce pollution.

#### Feedback and Information

- Informing people about the pollution hazards by warnings.
- Force industries to disclose their emissions accurately on a public website before going ahead with the project. This helps reduction because no one wants to be the worst one on the public platform. As social activists and news channels will arrange for bad pr.
- Fuel economy stickers, which tell people how much will they save in 5 years if they choose any car,


#### Ambitious Environmental Nudges

- An ambient little orb that glows red when a customer is using a lot of electricity
- People sharing their energy consumption on Facebook or other public platforms.
- Voluntary participation programs are designed to assist companies who want to preserve the environment.
- Sometimes there are no extra costs and a little extra benefit to go green but executives don't get to it because they are busy. The voluntary participation programs can help. Example Energy star.
 



### Chapter 13: Improving School Choices

- Children have the right to a good education
- If schools compete, kids win.
- One way used in the US to provide a better choice to parents is a voucher. A voucher is a financial help which government proves the parents for a private school. Essentially government will give some money to the parents assuming anyways that money would have been spent on the kid if he was in the public school/
- Critics of vouchers argue that
  - This money would be taken from public school funding. Hence the school would lose both, students and money.
  - These vouchers will be used by the rich to subsidize their kid's education.
- How the school competes is not made clear in the chapter.
- But they talk about setting some standard performance metrics for each school and then allowing the parents to switch if the publically available performance data is not great.
- The problem with this is a very less number of parents take the option of switching schools.
- And those who try to do are politely discouraged by the authorities.
- To encourage people to switch RECAP can be used with the information of school's performance scores.
- Students can also be nudged to go to college by mandating that to pass school they have to fill an application and necessary help to fill it should be provided.

### Chapter 14- Should Patients be forced to buy lottery tickets

- In the US, health care is very expensive
- One reason it is expensive because in a sense the cost includes the patient's right to sue.
- The proposal of the chapter is that instead of forcing people to buy the right to sue. It should be made optional. This moving from non-libertarian paternalism to libertarian paternalism.
- Studies have also shown that people who get negligent treatment don't generally sue and people who sue and win did not get negligent treatment
- To make it easier for people to choose between buying medical treatment with and without the right to sue we can rely on employers as insurance is generally bought through employers.
- Also we can break down malpractice insurance further into negligent treatment and intentionally harmful treatment.
- Right to sue is anyways not helping because the patient does not even know how much they should receive for the injury caused.
- Hence a libertarian paternalistic approach can bring down costs and help doctors and patients.

### Chapter 15: Privatizing Marriage

- Official marriage is currently a license from the state which covers two parts. The official approval or recognition of individuals' commitment towards each other and the other are material benefits, like tax benefits, transfer of assets on spouse's death, etc.
- Such a system pisses at least one side. Either the religious institutions who don't want to support same-sex marriage or the homosexual couples who want to get married.
- To solve this, marriage can be broken into two parts. The part concerned with the law can be called a civil union which would be a well-defined contract with all the material and legal benefits and with all the checks and balances in place.
- The marriage part which concerns approval can be delegated to marriage granting organizations. It is up to the organization to support the kind of marriage and couples can choose the organization suitable for their needs.
- This way both parties get what they want and no one is offended.
- Hence marriage will become a strictly private matter performed by religious or other private organizations.
- None of the laws would depend on a couple's status to being married. They would just be based on whether or not there is a civil union between two individuals
- This also is desirable because state control of marriage is outdated. It was required before to make sure it is not easy to leave your spouse. But nowadays it has become easy.
- Also the status of single or married does not even represent all the flexible options people want to realize in a relationship
- With good defaults in place in the civil union which clearly describes what happens in case of death and separation and also favors the vulnerable party we can create a system that offends nobody includes different relationships in the society.

## Part 3: Extensions And Objections

### Chapter 15: A Dozen Nudges

1. **Give More Tomorrow**: Just like Save more Tomorrow but for charity
2. **The Charity Debit Card And Tax Deductions**: A debit card only used to give for charity. And only charities would accept that. At the end of the year, the bank would generate a statement that can be used as a deductible in tax filing.
3. **Automatic Tax Return**: For people who don't have any income the returns would already be filled out. Just verify, sign and send. To compel people to check there can be a prize of 100% if there is a mistake.
4. **Stickk.com**: To make sure personal goals are achieved. Financial and Non-Financial agreements. In financial, give the money on the website and specify how would it be verified that the goal is achieved. If the goal is achieved money is returned else it's given to charity. For non-financial commitments, your friends will get to make fun of you if you fail on social media. If you succeed they will share your achievements
5. **Quit Smoking Without A Patch**: A bank account where you deposit money whenever you generally smoke a cigarette. After six months a urine test is taken. If the person fails to take the test, the money goes to charity
6. **Motorcycle Helmets**: People are allowed to not wear helmets if they apply for a special license. The license requires to take an advanced riding course focussed on safety and also asks for health insurance documents as proof.
7. **Gambling Self-bans**: Gamblers can request the state to put them on the non-gambling list. Once there they should not be allowed in Casinos
8. **Destiny Health Plan**: You get points for verifiable healthy choices and the premium is reduced.
9. **Dollar a Day**: Pay teenage girls a dollar for every day they are not pregnant. Might sound trivial but it works.
10. **Filters For Air Conditioners**: Changing filters on time is not obvious. AC breaks down and people have to pay the bills.
11. **No bite nail-polish or Disulfiram**: The first one is obvious, the second one can be used by people wanting to quit drinking. They can take Disulfiram and then consuming alcohol will make them feel nauseous.
12. **The Civility Check**: Angry, abusive mail would be detected on clicking send and will advise you to send it 24 hrs later.
