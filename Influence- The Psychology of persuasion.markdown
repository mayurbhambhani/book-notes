###Introduction

The books is about the psychology tactics are used by compliance professionals(Salesmen, fund raisers, recruiters, advertisers) to get us to do that is beneficial to them and how can we protect ourselves from those tactics.

The author has used the following methods.

1. Experimenting in the university with students
2. Then worked with compliance professionals as a participant. Meaning he posed as a sales trainee to learn the method of the salesmen
3. The persuasion tactics fall under six categories 
	* Consistency
	* Reciprocation
	* Social Proof
	* Authority
	* Liking
	* Scarcity
4. One category not included in above six is the motivation of getting something we need at optimized cost. It goes without saying that it is one of the techniques. Hence it deserves to be acknowledged but doesn’t need to be described.



###Chapter 1: Expensive = better and perceptual contrast.

1. Jewelry store double price example. 
2. Turkey Example. Turkey tends to offsprings only because of the sound, It will even tend to its enemy, if it makes the same sound. Automatic pathways which manifest on a trigger.
3. In a Xerox line if you ask to skip saying “I have 5 pages.can I skip the line?” , you will get away with it 60% times. If you add a reason with some info you will get away with it 94% of the time . Ex “I have 5 pages.can I skip the line because I am in a rush”. You will get away with it 93% of the times if you just use the word ‘because’ w/o any new information.’I have 5 pages.can I skip the line because I have 5 pages’
4. Automatic Behavior patterns are useful to save brain strain, but someone who knows how they work can dupe us.
5. A tailor will admit to a hearing problem or will ask the customer to repeat their responses. When asked for price he will call his brother and pretend to heae 42 as 22 dollars.
6. There is something called the contrast principle which can be illustrated as following points.
7. Average looking women will seem less attractive if we look their pics after watching Charlie’s angels
8. Warm water left hand, Cold water right hand, then both water together in Luke warm water. Left hand feels it as cold water and right hand feels it as warm water. The same water feels different because of the preceding events. 
9. In clothing stores, costly items are shown first. After that all the other items seem cheap, even if they aren’t.
10. In real estate, undesirable properties at inflated prices are shown first. They are called setup properties.
11. Car salesmen will suggest the accessories separately **after** the price of the car is negotiated. $200 accessory looks nothing compared to the $15k car.



###Chapter 2: Reciprocity 

1. Mexico Ethiopia Aid. Even when Ethiopia was dirt poor it sent 5000$ aid to Mexico for earthquake relief because of a help Mexico had given Ethiopia 50 years back
2. The Hare Krishna foundations asking for donation after handing the prospect a flower.
3. The Coca Cola example. This experiment was conducted on people one by one. In half of the experiments subjects were given a coke by another participant who later asked them to buy 25cents raffle tickets from him. Without the Coca Cola people bought if they found him likable. With the Coca Cola people bought anyway. This technique can be used by salesman who know they are not generally likable. Hare Krishnas were also not likable because of the way they dressed and looked. Hence they used the reciprocity tactic.
4. Not given in the book, but Godfather.. enough said.
5. How bad it feels to eat the free sample of noodles in a mall or outside the grocery store and then not actually buy.
6. Blankets distribution before election.
7. Even the the favor done to us was not asked for by us, we feel indebted. If we specifically asked for it then the likelihood and the intensity for the response would be even higher.
8. The same technique was being used in Himachal Pradesh by the photographers. He helped Jasmeet and myself with how to climb on the slow mountain. In Taj Mahal as well same thing had happened. The masjid caretaker offered to take a photo and expected monetary reward after that. Same thing happens outside Tajmahal and Fatehpur Sikri as well.
9. The probability of putting someone in debt increases if they have no choice of rejecting the gift. 
10. Nice Guys do the same thing to get the hot girl.
11. This rule can also trigger unfair exchanges. We might feel obliged to loan a car to someone who helped us change a tyre some time ago.
12. Reciprocal concession. If you are not buying a $5 ticket from me, would you like to buy $1 chocolate? Concessions ,like gifts, are also reciprocated. Concession is treated as a favor. If you want to ask for a favor and you feel the other person will decline. Ask for a bigger favor first and on rejection propose the favor you actually wanted.The actual second request doesnt need to be a small one. It just needs to be smaller than the first one. This technique is called rejection-then-retreat. And it works because it is a combination of reciprocity and of the perceptual contrast principle of Chapter 1. But if the first request is insanely big, then the negotiation doesn’t seem genuine and the tactic backfires and the concession is not reciprocated. 
13. Disadvantages: On realization the deal might be called off. The subject may decide never to deal with the manipulative party again. But data shows not many will realize the manipulation and the rejection-then-retreat is better for future endeavours as well compared to just offering the smaller request directly. This happens because the victim party feels responsible for the concession given by the exploiting party and due to this the victim party feels satisfied with the results.
14. How to say no. If you say no to every favor offered, you might end up offending genuine people with genuine favors. The way to do is it recognize that favors have to be obliged with favors but tricks don’t have to be obliged with favors. The moment you recognize it was a trick, or the asked for return favor is much larger than the initiating favor, you can consider yourself free  from any obligation. From this point onwards you have to decline each and every request the person makes. The default answer is a polite no for everything he asks for. The default answer is yes to all his favors and concessions. As he is trying to exploit you, you should also exploit him. Reciprocity indeed.



### Chapter 3: Consistency and Commitment.

1. As consistency and commitment are desired traits and a demonstration of absence of this trait can make us undesirable. We have an obsessive need to act in a consistent way.
2. Example of Sara and her loser jobless, drunk boyfriend Tim. Who refused to get married and Sara broke up with him. Sara started dating some other old boyfriend who proposed marriage and Sara agreed. But later the wedding was called off by Sara as Tim called her and offered to quit drinking and be better. Tim moved back in with Sara and after a month decided he wont make any changes. And Sara was even more devoted then before, because this behavior was consistent with her big decision of calling off the wedding,
3. Beach example. If somebody has agreed to watch your things, the chances of them saving your things from danger or theft increases a lot
4. We also use the commitment thought pattern and the corresponding action as a wall where we can hide from logic. The author gives the example of  a transcedental meditation workshop where author’s colleague destroyed the presentation by pointing out logical errors and still the sales increased that day because people who really wanted to use TM for solving their deep problems didn’t want to end up not joining by giving logic enough time to convince themselves on not joining.
5. The toy store example. Cool toy adds would be shown before Christmas. Parents will promise kids to buy the toys shown in advertisement. Around Xmas the supply of the toys would be low. Parents will try alternative toys of the same value. After Christmas the toys would be again available and now the parents will buy again to fulfill their promise. Hence even after the toy season the sales would continue.
6. The volunteer example. First people are asked how many people do they thing will volunteer for a cause. After some days they are again phoned and they are asked whether they would volunteer. In the first call, people tend to say that most of the people will agree, to appear good to the caller and themselves. In the second call they will feel a compulsion to say yes just to act consistently with their previous statement.
7. The chances of contribution in donation solicitation increases if the solicitor starts with “How are you feeling this evening”. After admitting that everything is fine its hard to find an excuse to not contribute.
8. Chinese psychological techniques on US soldiers. First get US soldiers to admit that US is not perfect. Then make them say that communist economies are better in some cases. Then make US soldiers create a list of points where they think US is wrong. Then broadcast the list on the radio. Where the US soldier starts feeling that they have volunteered to go against US. And then they start aiding the Chinese. All this because everyone wants to maintain consistency.
9. Foot in the door technique.  A question came to my mind while reading the book. Don’t foot in the door technique and rejection-then-retreat techniques contradict each other.
10.  Foot in the door technique example. Likelihood of people saying yes to billboard installation in their front yard increased if they had recently agreed to a minor request for public welfare. This kind of initial small requests alter the self image and identity and once its altered the need for consistency can make us do crazy things.
11. Experiments done by Chinese on US soldiers clearly show the people try to align with what they commit to in writing.
12. Written commitment device has advantages. Firstly, it is evidence. Secondly, It can be shown to other people.
13. In US, when there came laws which allowed consumer to return and get refund in a month. People convinced that they have been duped as a result of psychological trick will cancel. To avoid that they made the customer fill the sales agreement. Hence a written commitment. That reduced the cancellations.
14. Another example of commitment is, fraternity initiations. If you work hard to get something, it would seem more worthwhile.
15. Why the essay competition awards in Chinese pow camps were so small? And why public service can not be used as initiation? Both have the same answer. Because the person committing should not think later that the commitment was a result of a better reward or a good cause. He should feel that he committed because he wanted to. He must own the decision.Social scientists have determined that we accept inner responsibility for a behavior when we think we made the choice w/o any external pressure.
16. This has importance is child rearing. The robot toy example. “I will punish you if you play with the robot”” was a short term strategy. “Playing with robot is wrong”” also worked long term. Thus while convincing the child the outward pressure should be very less detectable.
17. The low balling technique. Example from car dealership. Offer a car fairly low compared to competitor. This makes the customer decide that he will buy the car. Now take him for a drive. Make him sit in the car. Make him fill forms and sign them. And then tell him that there is an error in calculation. And the price is equal to the general market price. As customer has already committed in various forms. He will buy. Basically offer an advantage to trigger an inner decision. Go through commitment rituals. Remove the advantage.
18.  Lowballing can also be used to do some good. The energy saving example. People were told that if you reduce your AC usage and save electricity, we will publicize your name in papers to give recognition. After a month or so the promise was retracted. But the electricity saving behavior remained and even improved. 
19. How to say No. Listen to the pit of the stomach. If not, listen to your heart of hearts. Or ask yourself, Given the information I have now, If I can go back in time would I make the same choice.



###Chapter 4: Social Proof

1. The principle of social proof states that when we are uncertain what to do, we try to determine the course of action by looking at others. Our probability of doing the same thing is proportional to the similarity between us and others.
2. Canned laughter in comedy shows tricks us into finding something funnier than it actually is.
3. Bartender and begging jars are pre filled at the start.
4. Advertisements always have common people using the products. People like us.
5. Shy children were shown videos of shy child of their age who just joins a crowd and starts interacting happily. This was helpful in changing the behavior.
6. Example of a cult where the cult leader informed about an apocalypse. She also told that Jesus’s embodiment is on another planet and communicates with her through ‘automatic writing’ and God wanted them to move to another planet 7 hrs before the apocalypse using a flying saucer God will send for them. The cult members cut all social ties, sold all their property, spent all their money and basically turned their back on the world. And they avoided all publicity. But when the saucer did not come and the automatic writing informed them that the apocalypse has been cancelled as God was so happy with the cult that he forgave the whole earth, they started informing press and decide to spread the word and convert people. This happened because when the physical proof was absent, the only way to save their belief system was making sure other people believe in it too and hence social proof will make them believe again.
7. Suicide rate, Car crashes and airplanes crashes increase in a particular area after a high profile suicide story is published in that area. This is called the Werther Effect. A book was published in France who had the main character named Werther who commits suicide.
8. Many people witnessing an emergency sometimes fail to take action when the are not sure its an emergency. That is because they look at other people for cues. As other people are not sure and are trying to act calm and composed (as that’s how we want to be percieved), everybody starts acting the same way and no action is taken. This phenomena is called ‘pluralistic ignorance’.
9. If you need help from bystanders, point to a specific individual and direct them to a specific action. “”Hey sir, you the one in blue jacket, Call an ambulance”. This statement makes it clear that there is an emergency. It assigns clear action to a particular individual. Thus removing all ambiguity. When there is no uncertainty, the person assigned the task would be sure of himself and wont look for social proof. Don’t be embarrassed in asking for self. The price of embarrassment is nothing compared to your life.
10. How to say no. 1. When you see false data is provided (canned laughter) disable the autopilot. 2. Validate the social proof by taking a glance in your surroundings. The lane switching example. If 4 car in front of you are switching lanes, you assume something might be wrong with the lane further ahead and you try to switch it too.


###Chapter 5: Liking: The friendly thief

1. We tend to positively respond to requests put forward by people we like. It might be startling to note there are multiple strangers who use this effect to make us comply to there requests.
2. Physical attractiveness generates a very powerful halo effect. Physically attractive people seem more intelligent, receive easy help from people of both genders. Attractive criminals get lighter sentences and teachers view aggressive acts as less naughty when performed by attractive students.
3. Another trait which make us like others is similarity. We tend to like people who are similar to us more. People who dress like us, look like us, mirror our body language are perceived as more likable. Example of the car salesmen who claim to have similar background, interests, views and habits.
4. Compliments is another tactic which can be used by others to get us to like them. Car salesmen example to used to send I like you cards to his customers every month. Even when we know that the compliment payer has something to gain out of us, we cant help the effect compliments have on us.
5. Contact and Cooperation:  This I have witnessed firsthand in Agra. Agra is home to a lot of world famous Mughal monuments. At any of this monuments the moment you park your car in the parking and get out of it, there would be at least one guide offering cooperation in way of telling you to leave your lighter inside the car, or offering information which is generally helpful to take the tour of the establishment. People taking advantage of this tactic will try to make you believe that you and them are working towards a common goal. That you both are part of the same team.  Another example is Good Cop/Bad Cop. Or a car salesman who battles with his boss to get us a better deal.
6. We also have a liking of familiar things. Voters often choose candidates whose name seem familiar. Although familiarity to a person with whom our interactions in the past have caused us frustration and negative feelings wont have the same effect. Example: exposing interracial students to each other in schools wont make children like people from other race better. The reason for this is that school is competitive environment.
7. Conditioning and Association: We like people/proposals associated with good events and circumstances. Example of news channel weathermen getting threats just because they reported bad weather. Example of White House dinners where donation proposals which were shown while people were eating food tend to get accepted. In older times the bearer of the bad news was slain and the bearer of good news got to choose between his favorite wines and women. Thats why people want to associate celebrities to associate with their product and political parties. All things being equal, you root for your own sex, your own culture, your own locality. Whoever you root for represents you and if they win you win that’s why we want that the teams we support win.
8. People who are named droppers. People who mention they know a particular famous person or put their pics with such people on display. They try to derive their self worth by achievements of the successful people they know.
9. How to say no. Realize that you are liking somebody w/o a reason and liking them more than the evidence permits. Then you will be tipped of that may be some tactic is being used. You don’t have to know what is the reason. Don’t confront the individual because they might be genuinely nice. But your decision should not be influenced by the fact that you like them. You have to drive the car, not the salesman.


###Chapter 6: Authority : Directed Deference
 1. The chapter starts by describing an experiment which was conducted to determine till what extent authority can drive people to do things. The experiment involves three participants. The researcher, a subject and a fake subject. The researcher give the fake subject a list of facts which has to learn in very little time and then he is tied to an electric chair and is asked questions on the facts. Each wrong response, the original subject has to push a button which delivers a fake electric shock to the face subject. The real subject although doesnt know that the shocks are fake. The real subject has been told the shocks are real and with each shock the shock intensity increase. As the experiment progresses the fake subject who is an actor begs for mercy to stop it, but the researcher keeps ordering the subject to deliver the shock whenever the answers are wrong or if there is refusal to answer them. This goes uptown the shock intensity of 450 volts. The hypothesis is that the subject could only do this because he was ordered by the researcher at each step to do so. To prove this point they conducted to similar experiments. In one the role of the researcher and the original subject was reversed. In another one the researcher was asking to stop the but fake subject was braving to continue. In both the latter situations the real subject decided to stop. These experiments were performed on a number of people and the results were mostly the same.
 2. Humans operate bu collaborating, Collaboration is very difficult without authority. So hence it is instilled in our minds that instructions by authority can trusted. This fact is used by con artists and compliance professionals. 
 3. This is possible because for effects of authority, authority itself is not mandatory. Just the illusion that the authority is present is enough. These illusions can be induced by the following.
 4. **Titles** : Experiment where nurses received phone calls from people posing as doctors and asking them to administer heavy dosages of unauthorized drugs. They complied in 90 % of the cases. Big titles also make us perceive the person with the title taller or bigger than he actually is. Humans also perceive taller individuals to have more authority. Hence con artists use lifts.
 5. **Clothes** : Commercials featuring actor posing as doctors. Conmen dressing as authority figure by dressing in good suits. People being more obedient to other people with security guard uniforms etc.
 6. ** Trappings**: People honk less at expensive cars
 7. How to say no: Ask two questions to yourself , Is the authority authentic. Meaning ask for an ID. Then ask yourself, how truthful we can expect them to be given the circumstances, is their a possibility that they are operating keeping their personal gain in mind? Are they seeming to be arguing against their own interest just to get our trust?
 
 
 
 ###Chapter 7 : Scarcity - The rule of the few
 1. Starts with an example where a restricted section of the Mormon temple was opened up for sometime during which the author got an urge to see it. He found that he was only interested because the opportunity was available for a limited period of time.
 2. The “limited edition” is also a similar technique.
 3. As a rule, anything , if its rare or is becoming rare, ends un increasing its value beyond its current worth
 4. Sales people also use the same tactic. Same is used in gym memberships. There is always a better deal if you sign today. Tomorrow the same offer wont be available.
 5. Th scarcity principle forces us to act because of two things, first is if a thing is rare or becoming rate means it is in demand and then instead of evaluating the thing itself our brain takes a shortcut and uses the demand to determine the value of the item. Another reason this work is psychological reactance.
 6. Psychological reactance say that if the item is available to us now and then we are informed that it is not going to be available in future, then we desire it more and we fight for it more. Even if we don’t want to use an option or we are not even aware of that option and someones denies us that option, we feel an urge to fight for that option. 
 7. Kids master this concept between the age to two to three and consequently only want to play with toys which are denied to them and only want to do things which are restricted. Teenagers go for boyfriends/girlfriends their parent wont approve of(Romeo-Juliet ).
 8. If you want to discipline your children , never make concessions in the discipline routine. If you are not consistent in enforcing the discipline, after every concession the child will fight even more furiously for that concession. Children should exactly know when are they supposed to autonomous and in what areas they are to be governed. Inconsistent information only worsens the situation.
 9. This is the reason teenager focus more on their rights opposed to their duties. The duties take up their freedom or choice of not being responsible. The rights are things which they are entitled for and are being denied.
 10.  Its been proven by research, the more the adolescent love is opposed by parents the more ardent the love is.
 11. Same thing with information Sensor it and people wont only want to know about it more, but also they will believe it more.
 12. Revolutions also happen when people are given a small taste of good life and then those prospects are taken away.
 13. When it comes to freedom, its more dangerous to give it and take it away compared to never granting freedom as an option.
 14. Parents who enforce discipline inconsistently produce generally rebellious children.
 15. Not only do we want the same item meow when it is scarce, we want to more if we are in competition for it. The ardor of an indifferent loved surges with arrival of a rival. Real estate agents will call the current prospects with new that another rich party wants to buy the same property for tax purposes. Author’s brother used to sell used cars after, buying it, cleaning it and then giving all the prospects same time of appointment. The presence of multiple buyers always made the car more desirable than it actually was.
 16. How to say no: Use the unexplained desire to flag you. And then ask yourself, you are making the decision to just “have” the scarce item, or we actually want to use it. And if we want to use it. Is the utility worth the price.
 
 
 ###Epilogue
 
 Our brain takes shortcut and they are extremely useful. Anyone missing these shortcuts is doing us a great disservice by reducing our belief in these shortcuts. Whenever we find this is happening, we should be prepared to use boycott, confrontation, censure, tirade, nearly anything to retaliate.
