# Summary

Don’t trust the goal, trust the process. Anybody can have goals. Goals will make you happy only in the end for a short time and then you will move the goal post. Process will always keep you happy.
Don’t focus on outcome. Focus on identity. First decide what kind of person you want to be. Align the process to that identity and then the outcome will follow.

Change of identity will feed the process and daily following of process will give you small wins which will enforce the identity. There would be times you would fail but the goal is to win majority of the times. Each win is a vote for your  new identity and each loss is a vote against your new identity
There are four steps to a habit
1. Cue
2. Craving
3. Response
4. Reward


For good habits
1. Make the cue obvious
2. Make it attractive to ensure craving
3. Make the response very easy to do
4. Make the reward satisfying.


For bad habits
1. Make it invisible.
2. Make in unattractive.
3. Make it difficult.
4. Make it unsatisfying.

## Make it Obvious

Good and Bad habits become automatic after sometime. You will need better awareness and monitoring of your behavior. Use pointing-and-calling and habit scorecard(list your day habits with a positive and negative sign in front of them) to be aware. Raise awareness first, before change.


To make the cue obvious

1. Create implementation intention to increase the probability of you doing it. I will do [BEHAVIOUR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]
2. Use habit stacking. A habit linked list slope if you will. Insert nodes into this linked list slope.
3. Set up your environment in such a way that guides you for the habit, discourages for the bad habits and basically makes things easier for you.. Keep the books you want to read where you can see it. Keep the fruits on the dining table and snacks should be hidden.
4. Use one space one use principle
5. You optimize what you measure. The electric meter example.
6. Its easier to build habits in the new env because you are not fighting against old cues.


Self Control
1. Don’t rely on it. It’s a short term strategy. Wont work in the long term.
2. Eliminate the cue.
3. Vietnam Heroine example.
4. Be very very careful what habits are you forming, Habits are never forgotten. Exposed to the same cue, you will feel the same  craving.



## Make it attractive

1. More dopamine is released during anticipation stage as compared to realiazation.
2. Use habit bundling to make your habits attractive. This can be done by combining needs and wants. Whenever you need to check social media first do 10 pushups kind of thing.
3. Then plug this need+want package into the habit stacked linked list slope.
4. We want to fit in. Habits which are norms in our culture are easily picked up. We tend to initiate the habits of three types of people. The close, The many and The powerful. One way to make your habits attractive is to become a part of the culture where your desired behavior is the norm and additionally you have something in common with the group. The habit becomes attractive because of the approval.
5. Every behavior has a deeper motive and a surface level craving.
6. Behavior is the result of the prediction that it will satisfy the underlying motive. 
7. Replace bad behaviors with good to satisfy the same underlying motive.
8. This can be done by highlighting the benefits of avoiding bad behavior.
9. Habits are attractive when they are associated with positive feelings. Petting the dog example.
10. Phrase if positively. Change your perspective. You don’t have to exercise, you get to exercise.




## Make it Easy
1. You can make it easy by repetition
2. The photographer quality and quality example.
3. Practice is far more important than planning.
4. The more you do it, the more automatic it will become.
5. You can also make it easy by redesigning your environment in such a way that good habits are easy and have less friction and the opposite for bad habits.(gym is on the way to work, snacks are hidden, remove remote batteries after watching tv).
6. Ritualize first. Standardize and then optimize. Start a habit with the two minute rule. And then use habit phasing to proceed further. Even after increasing the duration. Focus for the first two minutes.Examples Manhattan dancer cab gym example. Workout clothes and office example.
7. Inversion is “make it difficult”. Also you can use a commitment device. Lazy French author example.
8. Automate your habits using technology when you can. Tech related habits can be made difficult by uninstalling apps or blockers.
9. Use one time choices to further make bad habits difficult and good ones easy. Example , want to be happy, buy a dog, want to eat less, use smaller plates. Etc

## Make is Satisfying
1. What is immediately rewarded is repeated, what is immediately punished avoided. Immediately is the key word here
2. Examples: Hand washing in Karachi, Toothpaste with mint.
3. Reward ideas: Add money to a jar for the next trip, Buy a book, Give yourself free time.
4. The first 3 laws make sure the habit is performed. The last law makes sure that the habit is also performed the next time.
5. Bad habits reward immediately, good habits have a delayed reward. Hence Bad habits are easy to develop.
6. The reward comes at the end of the desired behavior and the punishment comes at the end of the non-desired behavior. Because we tend to remember the end of the activity better than the start of the activity.
7. Habit trackers is a way which helps with cue, craving, response and reward. Visual reminder of progress is very rewarding.
8. Don’t break the chain.
9. Never miss twice.
10. Remember the dark side of habit tracking. Don’t measure the wrong things because we optimize what we measure. Also choose a measure which is motivating. Weighing scale is a bad measure.
11. Accountability partner. Monetary punishment


## Advance tactics

1. Genes should help you decide what habits to pick up.  That is the best ways to ensure that your habits align with your personality and are satisfying in the long run.Work hard on things that come easy.
2. Boredom is a danger for your habits. Keep yourself interested by expanding your boundaries a little bit. 
3. Winning 50% of the times is ideal for keeping yourself interested. Thats why I love online chess. But even then there might be boredom. And that’s the difference between pros and amateurs. Don’t be a fair weather practitioner.
4. The downside of creating habits is its so automatic after a certain point that errors are ignored.
5. Habits +Deliberate Practice = Mastery
6. Have a reflection and review process and remain conscious of your performance.
7. Have a flexible identity.  I am not a coder. I am a problem solver.
