# Behave
## Chapter 1: Behave


- There are many disciples where behavior can be justified and reasoned about. But no one thing explains it completely. Hence the book will analyze behaviors by examining what happened a second before(neural), some time ago(hormonally), and a civilization ago(culturally)

## Chapter 2: A second before.

- Need to go to appendix 1 before starting the chapter
- Whatever has happened the final behavioral trigger will pass through the brain. 
- Hence all other things we learn about behavior will associate with this part.
- Triune Model: A model which helps us think about the brain as three metaphorical layers.
  - First layer responsible for functions like hunger, shivers, etc. The earliest in the evolution. Lizard brain.
  - Second layer: Emotions. Evolutions of mammals brought this.
  - Third layer. Abstraction, concepts, memory, logic. Primates have this.
  - There are drawbacks and limitations with this approach of thinking about the brain but we will use this.
- The Limbic System: Layter 2. Responsible for emotions. Fuels our best and worst behaviors. Regions responsible, Amygdala, hippocampus), septum habenula, mammillary bodies.
- There aren't regions in the brain that can be called centers for particular behaviors. This means that the circuitry connecting various limbic structures is immensely complicated.
- Hypothalamus, a limbic structure, acts as an interface between layer 2 and layer 1. 
- From mid-brain to brain-stem along with their projections(signals) down to the spine and out to the body are collectively known as the autonomic nervous system. It is responsible for the automatic actions. For which we don't consciously think. Sweating, temperature regulation, etc.
- Automatic responses due to emotions are because of the hypothalamus. Eg. Breakup causes hunger for comfort food or fear makes us urinate.
- Automatic nervous system has two parts, sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.
- SNS mediates the body's response to 4fs, fear, fight, flight, and sex.
- PNS is the opposite, it is about calm and vegetative states.
- The SNS increases heart rate and PNS slows it down. The PNS promotes digestion, the SNS inhibits it.
- Hypothalamus also regulates the release of many hormones.
- Cortex: Here muscles are commanded to move, language is comprehended and produced, memories are stored, spatial and mathematical skulls reside here and decisions are made here.
- But this is all wrong because we know that if we hold a chilled coke in one hand and meet someone for the first time, we can judge them as cold. Meaning 2nd layer assessing the personality. 
- This is one of the disadvantages of the Triune model. It makes us think the functions are completely segregated and the communication across the layer is bidirectional.
- Frontal cortex is the interface between layer 2 and layer 3. It can also be thought of as an honorary member of the limbic system. 
- The interactions between the frontal cortex and the limbic system are going to be at the core of this book.
- Four lobes in the cortex temporal, parietal, occipital, and frontal.
- The brain has two hemispheres. Left and Right. These roughly mirror each other. This except for the relatively few midline structures, brain regions comes in pairs.
- Thus corresponding parts from both sides have related but slightly different functions.
- This is called brain lateralization.
- The greatest lateralization happens in the cortex resulting in the left brain being analytical and the right being more creative.
- The functional differences though, are very subtle between the two sides so much so that this book will ignore lateralization.
  
### The Amygdala
- Arguably most central to our worst behaviors.
- Sits under the cortex in the temporal lobe.
- Very much responsible for aggression.
- Also responsible for emotions that cause fear and anxiety.
- The amygdala is particularly sensitive to the unsettling circumstances that are social. An experiment is mentioned when the monkey is put in a room and its sexual partner in another room with a male rival. The monkey can hear the sounds from the other room. The monkey feels anxious.
 -Nervousness felt before public speaking is because of the amygdala.
- Being unsure of your place, or where you stand in a social setting, or in other words, not knowing what is your rank is also unsettling.
- Both innate(fear of snake) and learned fears(fear of Income Tax Department) are activated in the amygdala.
- Amygdala can learn fear(pair sound and shock and watch the conditioning).
- When shock and sound are decoupled again. Amygdala still remembers the scare but the frontal cortex learns that it isn't scary anymore.
- Amygdala also has a logical role in social and emotional decision-making. It helps us reject unfair offers. And that rejection feels like we are punishing the other party for a bad offer.
- It also makes us learn vigilance and distrust. The default setting is to trust.
- Amygdala, with one of its hypothalamic targets, also plays a role in male sexual motivation. Not in females though. Watching attractive female pictures will activate the reward circuitry. But if you have to press buttons to navigate through the pictures then the amygdala is also activated.
- The amygdala also has an outer layer, called BLA(Basolateral Amygdala). This is new and helps in learning fear. The inner one is for innate fear.
- Now we understand the amygdala has a graph node if we think of the brain as a graph, various regions being nodes and the axion cable connections between them as edges. Let's consider its input and output edges.
  - Inputs
    - All sensory systems(5 senses)
      - Generally, sensory systems go to the amygdala via the cortex region responsible for the sensation. But some sensory information takes a shortcut and reaches to amygdala directly. But the short-circuited information is not accurate. We might mistake a cellphone for a gun.
    - Information about Pain: Unpredictable pain activates the amygdala. Comes from [PAG](#pag)
    - Information about disgust: Comes from [Insular Cortex](#insular-cortex)
  - Outputs
    - Bidirectional connections: To [PAG](#pag),[Frontal Cortex](#frontal-cortex), Sensory systems.
    - The amygdala/hippocampus interface. Amygdala uses [hippocampus](#hippocampus) to store context information related to fear. The conditioning in rats between shock and tone can exist in cage A and not in cage B. Hippocampus will be used by the amygdala to remember this context.
    - Motor outputs: Amygdala can talk to the frontal cortex to get a motor response(pressing buttons to see pictures of attractive women). In case of an urgent situation, it can shot circuit the communication. You get more speed then but less accuracy. There is a trade-off. Meaning you will mistake the cell phone for a gun and before you know it's a cell phone you pull the trigger before you consciously mean to.
    - Arousal: Something emotionally arousing occurs, layer  2 amygdala signals layer 1 region, and heart rate and blood pressure soar. This can happen in case of murder and also in case of orgasm. Thus, the amygdala can't influence what you feel but increases the intensity of what you are feeling.
- Fear and aggression are not always connected. If aggression is not an option fear has the opposite effect. 
- Psychopaths don't need fear for aggression.


### The Frontal Cortex
- Responsible for working memory, gratification delay, knowledge organization, acting on a decision, long-term planning, regulation of emotion, controlling impulses.
- In short, *The frontal cortex makes you do the harder thing when it is the right thing to do.*
- This region is not fully online until people are in their mid-twenties.
- Frontal Cortex Anatomy: In the very front is the prefrontal cortex. The frontal cortex is new and the prefrontal cortex is the newest part of it.
- PFC is the decider. Resolves conflicts between cognition and emotions. Once it decides the signal travels as follows. PFC->FC->Premotor Cortex -> Motor Cortex-> Behaviour ensues.
- Categorical thinking is also handled by PFC. Organizing bits of information.
- Responsible for self-control.
- Prefrontal cortex takes a lot of energy if the cognitive load is increased on a task. The performance on the rest of the tasks declines. 
- But things also get automatic. Like driving, playing the piano. 
- Honesty also comes more easily thanks to automaticity.
- The example of Phineas Gage is discussed who lost is left PFC in an accident and his personality changed. More impulsive, more abusive, very little self-control, but after a couple of years his right PFC took over those functions and he recovered.
- During sleep the frontal cortex goes offline. Hence dreams are illogical and our behavior is unrestrained.
- During orgasms also it is off.
- Psychopaths have decreased activity in PFC and their PFC is less coupled with other regions.
- Cognition and emotion are not separated by a boundary. Mostly, they cooperate in decision-making.
- PFC is also divided into sub-regions. One is more logical another is more emotional in comparison. The emotional part is responsible for desire bias. For making us see things as we want to see them.
- Both parts are important. The emotional part uses emotion to give various options and then the emotional and logical part decides which option to go for. Without the emotional part, decision-making becomes difficult. The more emotional is the decision the more difficult it is.
- If the emotional part is absent, not only the absence will make making decisions difficult. The decisions which are finally made will be bad ones.
- The logical part is called dlPFC and the emotional part is called vmPFC.
- Damaging dlPFC will result in no self-control and damaging vmPFC results in detached behavior(like Sheldon, offending people without realizing).
- These two parts rarely oppose each other, they collaborate.
- Regulating thought: Don't not think about the elephant. Think about something else. The former is Response focused strategy and the latter is an antecedent strategy.

### The Mesolimbic/Mesocortical Dopamine System.

- Dopamine is synthesized in multiple brain regions. One region helps initiate movement, damage there will cause Parkinson's disease.
- The dopaminergic system that concerns this book arises from an ancient evolutionary conserved region near the brain stem and it's called tegmentum. 
- Tegmentum sends projections to the accumbens, amygdala, and hippocampus. This is called the mesolimbic dopamine pathway.
- Tegmentum also sends projections to PFC. This is called the mesocortical pathway.
- Club these two. We will refer to this as dopaminergic system
- If the tegmental release of dopamine is blocked, previously reward granting activities will become aversive.
- Chronic stress and pain depletes dopamine and decreases the dopamine neuron sensitivity and causes depression and anhedonia(inability to feel pleasure)
- Thinking about sex also releases dopamine.
- If you are on a diet, cheating once will make you want to cheat more.
- Generosity/helping others also releases dopamine.
- Rightfully punishing others also does that
- Schadenfreude(feeling pleasure in somebody else's pain) also increases dopaminergic activity.
- If the salary doubles, dopamine increases, then it comes down to original levels. If the salary comes back to the original level, dopamine declines.
- More from expectation means more dopamine less means less. The expectation information comes from the cortex.
- As humans have invented pleasures that are more intense than anything offered by nature we run a risk of habituation and desensitization. After a while, it is easy to be immune to the subtle pleasures of life.
- And we eventually habituate to the artificial pleasures also and then we feel an emptiness.
- Once the conditions of the rewards are learned. Dopamine is more about anticipation than the reward itself.
- That's why bad habits after someone has quit them, will try to reoccur in the environments where the bad habit used to occur. Because the anticipation of it releases dopamine. And then the craving ensues.
- If the guarantee of reward is reduced from 100% to 50% the anticipatory dopamine increases. But if the probability changes further on either side the dopamine sensitivity decreases
- Side notes: That's why the chess app feels good. Because it is designed in such a way that the probability of reward or winning is 50%. This is because you are always matched with players who are at your level. 
- Well calculated risk is addictive. Ambiguity is agitating. While betting if the probability of risk and reward is identical then the situation is addictive if the conditions of risk and rewards are well defined. If they are ambiguous, then no dopamine.
- Dopamine is not only responsible for the reward anticipation, it also aids in the goal-directed effort by sending the signals to the PFC. It gives us the motivation to act.
- Dopamine is not about the reward it is about the happiness of pursuit of the reward.
- When we have to choose between short-term gain and a larger long-term gain, contemplating the short-term gain with activate the limbic targets of dopamine and contemplating the long-term gain will activate the PFC targets.

### Serotonin
- Low level of serotonin results in impulsive aggression.
- Increasing serotonin levels won't affect normal subjects but it will affect subjects who are prone to impulsivity. Example Adolescents with the compulsive disorder.
- Serotonin follows the dopamine pathways that is, from tegmentum to accumbens, amygdala(Limbic), and then to PFC(cortical) and enhances dopamine's effects in goal directing behavior

### What all this info does not mean

- It shouldn't require neuroscience to validate someone's internal state: The argument given here is that to prove PTSD was an organic disorder, neuroscience was required and that shouldn't have been the case. The question of why it shouldn't have been the case is not argued. More about PTSD: In veterans, due to stress, the hippocampus is damaged. Hippocampus secretes noradrenaline which helps in therapy while sleep as mentioned in [Why we sleep](Why%20We%20Sleep.md)
- This info also doesn't mean that if neuroscience can demonstrate something, the validity of the proof is proportional to the fanciness of the neurobiology used.
- If neuroscience helps us understand the reasons why a criminal committed a crime, it doesn't mean we have to forgive him. Understanding doesn't mean forgiveness. For example, someone committed a crime because PFC was absent and someone committed even if the PFC was present. The reasons can be argued to be biological in both cases.
-Side Notes: These arguments I felt were not well-argued and it is easy to sway either way. Let us see if the coming chapters have better arguments.


## Chapter 3: Seconds To Minutes Before

- We will focus on the following questions
  - What outside stimulus, acting through what sensory channel, targetting what part of the brain caused a particular behavior.
  - Were we aware of the environmental stimulus.
  - What does this tell us about our best and worst behaviors.
- Ethology: The science of interviewing anumals in its own language. We will understand what sensory information prompts what behavior by looking at animals who get same sensory information but in wider ranges.
- Assumption is discoveries with this techniques will apply to all species. But these assumptions are not always correct.
- Emphasis on observing animals in their natural habitat.
- When female pandas are ovulating voice changes in the direction of the preference of the males. Same happens with humans.
- The most dominant sense will always have most direct access to the limbic system. That is the most dominant sense dominates behavior. And this is observed accross all species. Smell in rats, vision in humans etc.
- Over the seconds, sensoary cues can influence our behavior unconsciously. Reading a paragraph about ocean and then selecting among various detergents can make us choose Tide.
- Fear conditioning with seeing a face accompained with a shock occurs faster when the face belongs to a race different than the subject's
- If whites see a black face shown at subliminal speed(not enough for the brain to grasp what it actually saw) the amygdala activates. But if the face is shown longer enough then the prefrontal cortex is activated and inhibits the amygdala.
- Side Note: This is described by Louis CK in a comedy routined. He talks about how will he feel seeing a huge black guy at a gas station where he is standing alone late night. He starts with fears and than convinces himself that here is nothing to fear.
- The brain has a cortical region called *fusiform face area* that is responsible for facial recognition. With subliminal signaling, it is less activated for other races. Multiple things about race are discussed. Eg How we are likely to mistake a cell phone for a gun if it is of an other race etc etc. How african the face is might determine how longer the sentence is.
- Other types of subliminal information also influences the brain. Gender is detected in 150 ms. Same for social status.
- Direct Gaze, Open posture are signs of high social status, while averted gaze, sheltered torso are signs of subordinate social status.
- Halo effect is also described.
- Though we derive subliminal info from body cues. But we get most of the information from the faces.
- The shape of the womens' faces changes subtly during the ovulatory cycle. Men prefer female faces more when they are ovulating.
- People who look embarassed, blushing, eyes everted, face looking down, are easily forgiven.
- In face also eyes give the most information.
- Lets discuss another sense which helps in subliminal messaging, smell.
- Rats devote 40% of their brains to smell. We do 3%.
- Our olfactory system sends more direct projections to the limbic system than other sensory systems. 
- Heterosexual women prefer the smell of high testosterone males.
- Pheromones also signal fears. The smell of sweating from running and sweat from sky diving fear is different. And smelling such sweat also makes the smeller a little more scared unconsciously.
- Interoceptive Information:
  - The information which body gives us about itself also influences our behavior. Exm hunger, pain, etc.
  - It influences, not determines, our emotion
  - Pain makes aggressive people more aggressive it does the opposite for unaggressive individuals.
  - The amount of energy reaching the brain and the amount of energy needed by the frontal cortex has something to do whether the pfc is able to do the needed right thing or not.
- Unconscuous Language Effects: 
  - An unconscious priming with words influences pro- and anti-social behaviors.
  - Words can prime people and influence further behavior
- Group influences on beahvior is considered and it is said that the ByStander Effect does not apply in dangerous situation. On the contrary displaying heroics is likely to be considered. The new york killing incidence is also described. The same incidence is also described in in [Influence](Influence-%20The%20Psychology%20of%20persuasion.md). This book says its not the bystander effect but the other says it is. Dont know which one to believe.
- Other examples of how our social environment can influence our behavior is discused.
- Cleaning cities can drop crime rate in those cities.
- When shown a picture of an object embedded in a complex background, people from collective cultures(like China) focus more on the background and people from more individualistic cultre focus more on the object. Ask them to reverse this preference and the pfc gets engaged meaning the task becomes perceptually difficult.
- Thus a lot of things influence us seconds or minutes before a particular behavior and we are not thinking as autonomously as we would like to believe.


## Chapter 4:  Hourd To Days Before.







## Appendix 1:  Neuroscience 101.
- Neuron: The basic cell of the nervous system. We have hundreds of billions.
- They communicate with one another forming complex circuits.
- Glia Cells: Help neurons. Store energy for them.
- Glia cells are important but in this text, we will only concentrate on neurons.
- Neurons look like roots.
- A particular neuron: Dendrites=>CellBody->Axon=>Axon Terminals
- Think of neuron as a graph node with dendrites as incoming edges and axon terminals as outgoing edges.
- Electricity is passed through neurons when they are exited. It is passed as ions.
- When neurons have something to say it is positively charged. When it has nothing to say it is negatively charged.
- The negative state is called the resting potential. The positive state is called the action potential.
- The resting potential is also a very active process. It is not at all rest.
- A lot of neurons have to excite frequently for a signal to get propagated. With just some, it will generate a ripple not a wave.
- From dendritic spines(end fibers) to axon the signal system is analog. From axon to axon terminals it is digital.
- A neuron having multiple axon terminals means the charge with the current neuron has, is going to get distributed among all the neurons next to it. That means there is a trade-off between the number of neurons a neuron can influence and the average amount of influence it can have on each neuron it influences.
- In the spinal cord the graph is a linked list. In the brain, it's a graph.
- The average number of incoming edges and outcoming edges is around 10k.
- The axon hillock(the axon) has an analog threshold that decides that the signal will go further or not. This threshold changes over time and hence changing the neuron's excitability. Things that can change it are hormones, nutritional state, experience, etc.
- A type of glial cells wrap the axon. The insulation is called myelin sheath and the phenomenon is called myelination. This causes the action potential(positive signal) to shoot down to the axon terminals faster.
- The outgoing from one node connects to an incoming edge of another node. But the edge endpoints are not actually connected. There is a small gap between them. These gaps are called synapses.
- Then how the electric signal gets transferred from the axon terminals to the dendrites?  Neurotransmitters. These chemical messengers are released by axon terminals and are received by dendritic spines. The neurotransmitters fit perfectly in the cavities of dendrite spines.
- After use, these neurotransmitters are recycled or discarded.
- Hence the signal from one neuron to the next can increase/decrease in intensity while flowing through the synapse. By throttling the number of neurotransmitters. The concentrations of neurotransmitters can be increased by reducing recycling and discarding or by any other means.
- There are different types of neurotransmitters and they have different intensities of effect on the charge passed.
- The intensities can be negative as well.
- An action potential releases the same type of neurotransmitter from all axon terminals of a neuron. Hence each neuron has a type of chemical profile. It can only emit a certain neurotransmitter and that also means it can only talk to type A neurons.
- Examples of neurotransmitters: dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, acetylcholine, glutamate, GABA.
- Psychoactive drugs work by increasing or decreasing the level of neurotransmitters. They do this by increasing or decreasing relevant enzyme secretion.
- Neuromodulatory effect. If two neurons are joined by a synapse but the synapse is not between the axon terminal and dendritic spine but between an axon terminal and an axon then the former is inhibiting the latter. This synapse is called the axoaxonic synapse.
- Ways of signal sharpening: Feedback loop, Feed-forward, Lateral Inhibition.
- A sharp pain is handled via a feed-forward inhibition
- A throbbing pain is also handled by it. The only change is the instead of enhancing the inhibition of the middle neuron we inhibit the inhibition.
- Continuous pain can be stopped by sharp pain. An insect bite can be relieved by scratching. Is this because headaches can be helped by pressing the head.
- A neuron shared across networks helps the brain builds associations and thus makes us understand advanced concepts and abstractions.
- Neurons having similar functions are clumped together. Thus different parts of the brain do different things.
- Each brain region has millions of neurons.
- Some regions have very compact subregions which are called the nucleus. No relation to the cell nucleus.
- The region communication is done by clubbing many axons, from the region, together and forming a cable, and sending it to the other region.
- The cable or fiber tracts look white because of the myelin sheath around the axons and are thus called white matter.
- If somebody has a brain injury at spot X and he does something abnormally, can we deduce the region responsible for that function? Only when the region is not the fiber tract. If it is then you are only learning about the region which inputs. But it can be on either side.
- Even if the region in question is not a boundary we cant perfectly deduce the region as there are many regions responsible for one thing as all are communicating and no one region, in particular, can be called the most active participant.
- Side NoteS: But I guess with a lot of data we have created a brain map today.


## Brain regions:

##### Cortex 
- four lobes, frontal, occipital, temporal and parietal
##### PAG 
- periaqueductal gray. 
- Sends pain info to the amygdala
##### Hypothalamus
- Part of the Limbic system. Interfaces between Layer 2 and Layer 3
##### Insular Cortex/Insula
- A primary part of the prefrontal cortex. Causes vomiting by sending disgust signals to the amygdala. Can also be activated by thinking of something morally disgusting.
##### Frontal Cortex
##### Hippocampus
- Pendrives of the brain. Stores facts.
##### Prefrontal Cortex
- In the very front of the frontal cortex is the prefrontal cortex. The frontal cortex is new and the prefrontal cortex is the newest part of it. It is the decider.
